# Medieval Zombie ITS
You are a knight who received this titles after fending off bandits that were scheming to rob a few houses in this town. You live to serve the kingdom and her citizens. However today may be different job than you are used to. You wake up early in the morning to hear a sound of a knocking on your door. You hear the birds chirping and the neighbors blabbering so nothing seems to be amiss. You open the door to find someone special. The Duke of the King, someone who advises him in his most important work. You listen to him closely.
"Apologies to the rude awakening but the King and the Nodok's citizens has asked for your help. There is a problem occuring outside our perimeter that we cannot legally interfere with but we have alarm that there is an army brooding beyond. We cannot ask any of our higher nobles to help with your battle officially due to any higher seen nobles fighting beyond the Nodok's perimeter may be seen as expanding it. This will cause a feud between our allies and neutrals so we ask of you who is in lower nobility and that we can still trust. His Majesty has officially ordered you to fight this coming army and whether you win or lose, we appreciate your service."
And after finishing, he hands your a scroll with the King's official orders then leaves without another word.
How will you create your party?
> Finding mercenaries around town

The first place you could think of that will help you is finding mercenaries around town. Despite this being a peaceful kingdom, no kingdom is without criminals, the underlings, those who will do anything for money. And money that you have, being a knight pays well however you may not have that much compared to what other mercenaries get paid. You walk into the castle barracks to get your suit of armor, you have to look legitimate if you want to impress those who will be by your side. You notice a tavern on your way to the castle that you may want to visit.
As you put on your armor, you notice the other knights getting ready this early. Too late to ask for help now, maybe. Your shining armor and your sword will intimidate anyone who thinks otherwise if you. You leave the barracks to the tavern. It is in the nice part of town so you don't think you will find much here but you can try. You open the doors wide and everybody glares at you, surprised. You see some shady individuals immediately begin to get up and walk away to the back of the store.
Who will you invite to your party?
> Announce invitation for mercenaries

You walk to the middle of the room. Everybody looks at you as you go there. You clear your throats. You realize that you do not want to incriminate the King in anyways so you chose your words carefully.
"To those who believe that there is evil in the world that they must get rid of, this is an official invitation to follow me towards the end of the kingdom and farther to defend your families. This is not an order of the King but this is an order from the ones you love. To those who will join me, stand up and stand next to me. You will be a hero to yourselves and to everybody else."
Everybody looked dumbfounded as you said this and looked around. Some people blushed and walked out of the tavern. Some people stared at their food and drinks and not dare to look up.
What happens now?
> Wait for anyone to join

(A mysterious crow with a top hat flew down from the heavens and gave them fungus)
You continues to wait for anyone to join but it seems like nobody will join. You decide to wait at the bar and to get a drink. You can see the bartender sweat as they give you some ale without asking you what you want. You decide to take it anyways as it is probably because they don't want to get forced to join in. You look around the tavern once again and notice some people looking at you before looking down again. This is starting to get frustrating. You finish the ale, put some copper coins and leave. But as you leave the tavern, you hear someone behind you. It is a young, short adult female with orange hair. It's the bartender who just gave you money.
"Um, what's going to be the fight?"
You explain that you can say what it is but it will be important. She stares at the door to the tavern and back at you.
"I'll join you. I need the money but most of all, the glory."
Next step
> Find criminals to help

Realizing it may be harder to find companions than you initialize thought, you decide the next part is to find criminals. They may not fight for His Majesty but they will fight for money. The more you walk in the slums, you can feel the stench of the rotten fill your lungs. The walkways crack, the houses skew. As much as you love the kingdom, there is always part of the place that isn't beautiful. You find what you are looking for. Laws in place forbid you to break into a home without warrant of some kind but everybody knows this place is infested with criminals. It is a hideout of some kind. You try to open the door, it is locked. You knock on the door, nobody answers. You peak through boarded windows and see people looking back at you. The door opens, and you see what it looks like to be a dad and his sons waiting in the house.
"Yeah? What do you want? I got nothing and we ain't do anything."
How do you answer?
> Invite with money

You say nothing and have them a bag of coins. They say nothing and shake the bag, and look inside it then close the door.
The bartender named Anrial that you learned from walking here shows her suspicion of recruiting bad people to our group. 
"Do you really think they can be trustworthy? They already got their money, what if they kill us?"
You ponder that before the door opens against. The man gestures you go in. Anrial outright refuses to go in so you go in alone. What you see is a group of men sitting at a table. The presumed dad and his two sons and two other gentlemen. They gesture you to come closer. You are outnumbered and you aren't allowed to recruit criminals so if your body was found, if it was found, it would be dismissed as a crook. You walk to the table and see a map on what it looks like to be the slums. One of the older man looks at you.
"Which house do you want broken or you lookin' for us to off a man and 'is wife."
The man points to a random house while he talks. You just point to the outside of the kingdom. He shakes his head.
"We ain't do stuff like that shiny. Now get out heh."
How do you answer?
> Convince: "Gents, i'd also pick the house, under normal circumstances anyways. However, this quest outside the kingdom is a quest from the king himself. The pay will be nice, and since this whole ordeal is sorta under wraps, he may even grant us a pardon from our crimes. C'mon, whaddya say? The choice is yours as well, by the way." 

They all look at each other. The gentleman who spoke to you gestured you to move away. They all spoke in whispers. Despite being in armor, you feel afraid on what a group of lowlifes will say to you. One of them reached behind their back and placed a dagger on the table. The rest follows through. One of the men who you thought to be a son of the dad looked at you teary eyed.
"I've... I've done some bad things in the past. Things I don't want to do anymore. Things that still haunt me. I killed me mum. God will never forgive me but is it true that the King will?"
You look at the young man with a tear dripping down his cheek. You say to the young man that his life will get better from here and will start a new. Of course you don't know that the King will authorize this. They are lowlife scum that deserve to be put to death for what they done but right now, they are important. He perks right up.
"I'll join then."
The other presumed son gets up as well.
"Me too."
The older gentleman with scars on his face gets up too.
"Aye."
You nod your head and walked straight out the door.
What now?
> Leave the kingdom

As you walked out the door, you see Anrial talking to who appears to be the Duke. He looks at you sternly. 
"I will not argue with who you bring but there is something we need to discuss. Follow me to my room."
The criminals looked at the other member you have and smiles. Anrial moves closer to you.
You all walked to the castle. It is a grand beautiful stone and marble creation built by the servants of God and His Majesty. The grand door opens to show the hall. You go upstairs to the right into the dukes room. As an advisor to the King, it is looks a lot like the room for a king.
"I have important information I didn't disclose. You will be going to fight near our allies' kingdom of Pomm. They did not wish to help us out due to troubles we already have from before. Our situation is strained. We cannot show that a group from our kingdom fighting that army. Your armor and weapon? I'm sorry about this but we cannot give you our official armory but you have to get your own. Sorry not, we will give you five gold pieces in order to pay for any armor and weapons you wish for."
Where do you go?
> Armor shop

(plant a mushroom?)
You first walked into the barracks to take off your armor and your weapon. The other knights stationed looked at you weirdly as you would be leaving off shift but it's fine.
As you all walk to the armor shop. The gentleman who you now know as Isik explains that the guy who knows magic is somewhat feared by other criminals and tend to make other people go away. You pondered on that as you entered the shop. A flat faced looking man happily greats you. He shows you around the place. These aren't on par with the armor at home but they seem decent. You look at the things your party has.

Anrial - Cloth Armor
Isik - Hide Armor
Paul - Hide armor
Saul - Hide Armor

Shop 
Padded armor - 5 G
Leather armor - 3 G
Chainmail - 7 G
Scale armor - 8 G
Chain shirt - 6 G
Wood shield - 8 G
Knight Armor - 20 G

You have 22 G
> Buy padded armor

The flat faced shopkeeper brings out a stuffed piece of armor. It is better than clothing and it feels comfy to wear. You inspect your body all around and see that it fits quite well. You hand over the pieces of gold to the shopkeeper and leave on your way. Anrial notices your new shirt.
"You know, it's good that you at least bought something. Going out there with just your straps would be a pain."
> Go back and buy a shield
You go back in and the shopkeeper is surprised. He was busy staring at the gold pieces when you came in. He quickly put them away and showed the armor. You sheepishly grab the wooden shield and give him 8 pieces of gold as well. He looks ecstatic. You leave and follow Isik to that supposed friend he has who knows about magic.
> Follow Isik for the guy who knows magic

You go back in and the shopkeeper is surprised. He was busy staring at the gold pieces when you came in. He quickly put them away and showed the armor. You sheepishly grab the wooden shield and give him 8 pieces of gold as well. He looks ecstatic. You leave and follow Isik to that supposed friend he has who knows about magic.

You knock on the door to no reply. You knock again to no reply. You knock thrice then a large burly man opens the door. He appears to be wearing the armor of the castle. He immediately stops you and forces you back with a spear.
"HALT! Under orders of His Majesty, this house sanctioned to be housing the Knights of Nodok. Who goes there!"
> Convince the guard: "I apologize... I haven't properly introduced to thyself. I'm Horace K.D."
(name set to Horace Krispy Dinglebert)

You announce. You strike a pose similar to the one the guard is doing. The burly man slightly lowers his posture then looks around.
"I... I don't know who you are. I never once heard of you. Are you like some celebrity or something?"
You saw Anrial and Isik both facepalming but still with you regardless.
> "Yes, you haven’t heard of us? Part of the elite guard, not that you’d know about us"

The knight lowers his shoulders and just looks at you embarrassed. He looks behind himself to look at something then outside the place to see your party standing there.
"Uh, Elite guard? They don't exist... Right? You don't look like a guard. You don't even have a weapon or some metal armor. The people next to you look more guard like than you. Look sir, the doctor is around the corner and can help you."
> Bring out the scroll saying we're undercover

You sigh and bring out the scroll of His Majesty. You read through it and to make sure there is a signature on the paper and indeed there is on the King, Queen, and the Duke. The guard looks at it and begins to immediately bring out his spear once again. He swore at your face.
"You guys know of this place? I'll die before I let them find out what we do- what- what I do!"
On second thought, maybe bringing in the King's orders on a place Isik says may have the King under his belt is not the greatest idea especially since magic is forbidden and there is a knight here.
> ACT ==> Say we want to join them

You have nothing to defending yourself so all you could do is to ready your hands. Your party besides Isik rushed towards your side and immediately ready their weapons. The guard stares at your sternly. You try to quickly explain that you aren't here to bring him down but you want to join in. You brought out your scroll again and the Knight reads it at the top of his spear underlining the words. He stands quiet for a moment.
"They ripped you of your armor and weapons? They always send us on suicide missions. That's why I'm with the boss here instead of being stationed out there." He looks at the scroll and back at you. "Fine. You can come in but if you do anything fishy. I'm gutting you and myself. I got to speak with the boss." He closes the door and so you wait patiently reluctantly. After several minutes he comes back and allows you to come in.
You go into the grand house. It is nothing like the castle but it is remarking on its own. Custom made paintings fill the walls with double statues on either side that seem to follow you with their eyes. You continue to walk through the house until you find yourself at a living room of sorts. You find other people here who look very nice for someone who supposedly do bad things for a living. Even another knight. They glare at you, staring into your soul. The burly knight looks at your and your party.
"You all need to wait here. Everybody else, disperse. We got someone who can fix our problem."
They all leave without another word. The knight glaring at you snickered then follow the criminal group out. 
"Sorry about the delay. We don't want any undercover police coming here, no matter what their situation is. The boss don't want to talk to you so I will do. What do you want from us?"
> Say that we want to learn magic

You tell the burly knight that you are looking to study magic and hoping to accomplish something for your goal. He makes a noise with his mouth and flicks something on his shoulder.
"I'm afraid... That's not something we sell. You... You would be right that we have magic but the boss has a couple of them uh magic gems? He doesn't just give them out. He only gives them to those that can prove themselves that they can use it and very loyal. Uh, anything else you want?"
> Prove ourselves

You stood up and tell the knight you are worthy to prove yourself. Saul and Paul also stood up for you. Anrial however hesitated.
"I um... Not so sure about this? I thought we were doing this for the good of the uh Nodok Kingdom? I do not like this family."
> Leave Anrial behind with Isik and wink at her to say we're not actually joining

You turn your head to look at her. She looks pretty much afraid of this place. He gave her a little wink hopefully understanding what that means. She nods a bit but she doesn't seem fully convinced. Hopefully she will stay by you when the hard times come.
"Excellent! You have to follow us then. And leave your weapons here."
You leave your weapons as to continue this trust you want them to have. You go deeper into the building, going upstairs. You enter what looks like to be a conference room with someone wearing a mask and a robe at the end of the conference table. 
You sit down on at the closest chair along with your other party members sitting next to you. The masked man speaks in a gravely voice.
"A Knight falling down the dark path to secure his future? I can show you the road with us if you would like. You have to follow us with arms tied together. What does the fallen say to us?"
The knight who followed you nudged your arm. "He meant that metaphorically" The burly Knight coughs as he nudged your arm. "He is confusing at times"
> Accept

You say that you accept the invitation to join if that what you think he is saying.
"Excellent. I have a proposal for you. The soon to be corpse in rusted armor next to you has failed his duties of bringing my princess back. They yanked her while we are silent in the night. Quick as a fox and silent as a mouse. Nobody wants to get her in fear of somehow causing more damage to me by damaging my prized possession. Bring back my trophy and I shall kiss you with a magic gem. Follow the residence of the Ulays and pluck their flaming wick from their bodies."
You wanted to ask what that meant but before you could. The knight tapped your arm to signify that you should leave. You didn't want to overstay your welcome so you left. You walked back to the living room where it was still empty.
> Ask the guard about the princess

Horace asks the knight where is that princess his boss told him about.
"Oh... That girl. Um, some 'good' Samaritans called the Ulays has her. They are in the regular part of town. Actually near the edge of the capital. Go around, look for a brick home with a little girl running around usually."
> Go to a weapon store

Considering what may lie in that house and what the boss wants you to do, you consider going to a nearby weapon store. You walk down the street with your party members Isik, Anrial, Saul, and Paul now following you. Isik stays far away from the group after the talk you guys had in the house. You reach inside the store to find a familiar looking flat faced man cleaning the weapons on the rack. Excited, he shows you around.

Anrial - Short Wooden Bow
Isik - Short Sword
Paul - Dagger
Saul - Double Daggers

Double Daggers -  3 G
Short Sword - 5 G
Long Sword -  7 G
War Hammer - 7 G
Mace - 5 G
Flail Mace - 7 G
You have 22 G to spend
> Buy the Long Sword

You decide to buy the Long Sword for yourself. The shopkeeper greedily takes your 7 G and puts it in another bag. You leave the shop to find that Ulays residence. While you are walking to the edge of the town to find that place, Saul mentions that Isik now hates you before getting slapped by Paul. You didn't care to think about that for now but it would be good to remember that Isik is an old criminal with some grudges from all the years he lived. Besides thinking about that, you did reach the Ulays and sure enough, there are a couple of people living there and a little girl playing with a ball. They wave their hand expecting you to pass by but grow concern when you get closer to them.
> Talk to the Ulays: "listen we have a plan to help you get revenge on the shadow wizard money gang we are going to bring your girl to them but then she stab the boss once she gets close to him and this will distract them so you can strike and then we have a magic gem and everyone is happy"

You explain to these parents that you want to take down this gang that wants to take their child so you can get a gem. They look mortified.
"Why would we want our kid to kill someone? And to take a magic gem? Isn't that magic thing against the law and you want us to join? This- this is madness! I-I should report you to the authorities right now!"
> Take the kid and run

After messing up on what you said, you get nervous and decide to just take the kid and bring her straight to the boss. You tell the party to stall the parents. You run to the kid, scoop her up and immediately begin running to the direction of the gang. The only thing you hear behind you is the screaming and of both sides fighting.
The child in your arm doesn't seem to be crying and in fact just looks confused. In your mind, you are thinking of your Knight status that may be crumbling down if this goes bad. You come across a large open space full of people that is a market. It would be easy to go right through the place but there are a lot of guards around. You don't look that suspicious with the child not crying but you don't know about taking the chances.
> Take a detour

Not wanting to risk it, you decide to go into a nearby alley to slip past the markets. It goes into a winding pattern, making it hard to find where you are. You only know where you are because of what the castle looks like from angles but other than that you are lost. This goes on until you bumped into a patrolling guard, not a knight. You apologize to the guard but he stops you.
"What's with the running. You can stop and talk to me. Are you in trouble?
> Say "sorry we're late to an appointment"

You quickly say to the guard that you are late for an appointment for your daughter. The child says nothing but just stares at the guard. You try to be more convincing by trying to go around him.
"Oh sorry, you just looked like you needed some help."
The guard let's you leave and you take the time to try to find that house again. It does take you a while but no other guard tries to stop you and you manage to find that house. You knock on the door with your foot and that burly looking Knight answers the door. He looks surprised to see you and gasped when he saw that kid. He quickly ushers you in.
"How did you manage to get that kid without bringing attention to yourself. You know what, I don't care, give her to me."
Having no other choice, you give the girl to the burly knight where he presumably brings to the boss. He didn't even leave you in the living room where he left you before, you are just in the main hall. Several minutes have passed when you hear knocking at the door. It was slow before getting faster and harder. Whoever is out there must be in trouble or just impatient.
> Answer it

You decide to open the door, expecting something bad but instead you find your party members at the other side of the door. Anrial, Saul, Paul, and Isik quickly go inside. 
"We tried to stop them but they manage to get the police on us. We manage to lose them easily but we had to help Anrial. That stupid girl almost killed us" Saul angrily said. Anrial looks down and says nothing.
> Wait in silence

You decide to stand in awkward silence with your party in this tense air. Anrial is standing near the door looking down while the twins and Isik are just staring right through her. You watch them just look at stare for what seems to be a long time until that burly knight appears again.
"Alright he- am I interrupting something? I don't care actually, the boss wants to talk to you for doing this job."
He leads you through the maze of rooms and hallways into that same conference room you met him in. You sit in the same chair as you did before with the twins sitting in their chairs. Anrial is standing near the door, not daring to sit and Isik is nowhere to be seen. The strange man at the other end begins to talk again.
"Well done champion of the day. I have my beautiful daughter back from the nails of those disgusting frogs just licking up anything they see saying it is nature to do so. You are finally using your ears and mouth to what I am speaking unlike these idiots who can't tell what a goblin is to a miner. Now your reward! What do you desire for I am your genie for this moment."
> FUNGUS MAGIC!!

The strange man looks at you confused. If his head could rotate 180° he would. Anrial quickly apologizes for your eagerness and the twins are laughing.
"I'm sorry, he just talks about fungus magic all day I'm not even sure if that is even a thing-"
The hardened criminal boss laughs along with the knight.
"You must be a witch if you already know about our secret stash of garbage. The community of us found a gem for fungus magic or something but it must be God's joke because we couldn't find a use for it. You can have it for free if you want along with something new."
The party looks dumbfounded but Horace just smirks at everyone. He stops laughing immediately and just says he was half joking, you can get something else but don't expect much.
> Ask for money

The boss chuckles a little before continuing the coversation. The knight looks confused at you asking for more.
"You already bought the 2G fungus gem for free and you want money? I didn't not say you could get more but you will get three gold pieces then. Want more treasure? You can stay with us like that idiot Erin there is staying as family."
The knight leaves the room through the door next to the boss where he brings out a handful of gold pieces and a dark green gem. He places them on the table in front of you. You felt your happiness go through the roof with the new found fungus magic but you aren't sure how to use it. The boss shoos you out of the room and the Knight escorts you out of the house with no other thought. You find Isik waiting for you at the lobby with a new black eye. He doesn't say a word as he follows you out.
You look at the sky and it seems to be getting dark. You should go back to your home after today. You have done a lot and tomorrow should be a good day to leave for your adventure. You look at your party.
> Sleep together at your home

You didn't feel like trying to find everybody again so you decide to all sleep together at your home. It's glamorous but it can do well. You decide to bring them close to the castle walls which your house is near. Everybody enters your house and everyone is amazed by it despite you not seeing it the same as them. Perhaps you taken it for granted that you live in luxury that other people do not. Whatever the case, you do have your own armor and weapon rack for training weapons but it can be used for your real weapon. You place your sword on the rack and everybody realizes they should do they same and so they do except for Isik. You show them around the place which the twins and Anrial showing excitement but Isik is just following along. You showed them your living room and an unused room and they could take. Isik immediately goes into the unused room and shuts the door. Saul, Paul, and Anrial takes the hint and just stays in the living room.
> Try the fungus magic

You go outside while everybody is conversing. You look around for a stick and find a few twigs. You decide to test your gem on them to try anything. You gently squeeze the gem and imagine fungus growing on the twigs. You wait for anything but nothing happens. You close your eyes and squeeze harder and wait for something to happen. You felt heat emanating from the gem and your hand getting warmer and fuzzier? You look down at the twigs and see a small mushroom growing from each of them with roots connecting them all togther. You look at the gem and much to your terror, you realize your hand is covered in mushroom. You tried to shake it off but nothing happens, they stay on.
> Let it happen. Be the Knight of Fungi.

You watch your hands grow mushrooms. It vigorously pulsates, spreading around up to your wrists. Despite your physical well-being being in critical condition, you felt ecstatic. Your felt your muscles and bones ache with the cancer of mushrooms growing through your skin and forcing itself out. Strangely though, you felt your senses heighten as you become one with yourself. You always wanted to feel as one person but with this many organisms inside of you, you finally found happiness of having any different minds inside of you. The parallels of your split personality and the many minds of fungus fascinates you. You didn't realize you were crying from pain but it soon subsided. You look down at yourself. It felt stiff to move and every move that you do is painful but you slowly grow number to it. The little armor that you once had seems to be worn down by the fungus growing through it. You doubt anything will be comfortable on you.
Warning: all armor efficiency is decreased 
Higher chance of failure during combat
Health is increased 
Natural fungus scale like armor is automatically applied
> Sneak into your room

Despite coming to terms with yourself, you didn't want the party or anyone else to see you like this. There should be a window to your room. You stumble over to your side of the house to find a locked window with window boards closing it from the inside. You try to pull it open but it won't butch. Your bumpy fingers does not allow you to grip well.
> Walk through the front door

You didn't want to break down your own property and you came to terms to how you look. You decide to go ahead and get it over with by walking through the front door. You open the front door with the night light shining through, you look like a monster. Anrial screams immediately while the twins focus on the weapon rack next to you. Isik comes rushing out with his sword and immediately curses.
> Convince: "don't worry i'm fine"

You try your best to say that you are fine to Isik but you just stumble over your words. You cough and spores comes out from your mouth, spraying the room with it. Isik backs off and waves his hand trying to push the spores away. He doesn't seem to understand you. You try to speak again more clearly.
"What in the Lord's name is this monster! Horace get over here! I don't care if you are healthy, you are in our home!"
Isik swings his sword towards you. You try to dodge and block at the same time with your arm but it ends up slicing your arm, cutting chunks of mushrooms off. Blood oozes from the mushrooms.
> Write words with spores

You hold the dark green gem in front of you and squeeze gently. Isik is taken back at the sight of this. The mushrooms protruding out of you releases more spores than usual. You try spelling out anything using them. They do move around but they don't make any decipherable words. They fall to the floor aimlessly. Isik takes another swing at you. This time you manage to dodge it by side stepping backwards. Where the spores fall, fungus is quickly created. You manage to spell out the words Horace using the mushrooms. You point down the floor where the mushrooms are for Isik to read. He instinctively looks at what you are pointing at.
"My God, Horace? Is that you? A thousand apologies, I had no idea you turned into a ghoul. I saw the gem you were holding and got confused then I was thinking about what it did. Are you alright? We need to see a doctor right away."
> Go to bed

(name set to Horace Krispy Dinglebert the 3rd)
Horace Krispy Dinglebert the 3rd waved off Isik. You didn't think you needed a hospital. In fact, you felt pretty good besides the wound you just had. You stumble past Isik and the rest of your party who now had weapons to your room. The door opens forcibly showing off your bedroom with a bookcase and small terrarium that is already full of mushrooms. Seems like you been obsessed with them before this adventure. The don't need any taking care of besides nutrients so you just throw some old food in there that was on your desk. You look at your bleeding arm. You notice that there was a small blood trail leading to where the fight occurred. You didn't care to fix this so you just wrap your arm with some cloth you found in the desk you had to stop the bleeding. You slowly pulled yourself onto your bed where it bends down from the newly acquired weight you have gotten. You fall asleep like this and wait for the new day.
Health regenerated + 2
25/17 HP
You wake up to aggressive knocking on the door. It appears to be Anrial trying to wake you up. She talks through the door.
"Um, the guy says he is the Duke and he is mad or something. I think it is important."
You can hear her footsteps go quieter.
> Talk with the Duke

You felt a sense of dread thinking of everything you have done. You have done a lot of illegal things in the span of twenty four hours. You felt like you didn't think about the consequences of those actions, just the short term effects. You didn't even realize you were at the front door. You look around and everybody except Anrial is gone. You don't know where they went but it might be better if they weren't seen. You open the door to see the Duke of Nodok. The overweight man looks red with frustration. He stands back, shocked at what you look like but speaks.
"Knight Horace, what have you done to the her kingdom and yourself? His Majesty is in shambles finding out a recently knighted man to turn dark. I was getting reports of your misdeeds the entire day yesterday. I had to verify them myself. Section Cain guards have told me that they say you were having discourse with criminals and were even friends with them! As a Knight you should know you should loathe them as they stain Nodok. And- and have you seen yourself?! You look like a creature we kill without mercy. If I hadn't known better, I would have immediately called for guards but I have heard you have gotten to use magic. Look at yourself, this is the reason why we don't use magic. You don't know how to use it. You could have killed someone! In fact I need to quarantine because I'm near you. But I'm too angry to stop yelling at you. Once you finish with this mission, your Knight status is being revoked. Do you have anything to say for yourself?"
> Acknowledge what the Duke said

After everything the Duke said to you, all the possible things you wish you could have said, you couldn't say it. You just said that you understood what he said and will continue on the mission. The Duke turns back and says a few more words after sighing.
"Did you really do everything for your personal gain or to be a defender of Nodok?"
He walks away. You close the door and look back to see Anrial being worried. 
"So what happens now? Are we leaving?"
> Leave the kingdom onto your adventure

(name set to Horace "the crumpled paper" Jean Krispy Dinglebert the 3rd)
After a painfully long amount of time while you decide on that to do to the point Anrial was about to check up on you, you decided to leave Nodok and onto your adventure. The criminals exited the guest room as you were talking and they look ready. They had their armor and weapons ready taking it out of the weapon rack. You breathed in the fresh air with a hint of fungus and led your party to a road leading out of the kingdom. You passed by onlookers running away from your ragtag group of newly made criminals and a monster leading them. Leading out of the official territory where the houses are less, you found a small camp which had the Nodok symbol. A group of soldiers immediately came out as soon as they saw your group. They immediately ready their weapons. You get the feeling this will be a common occurrence.
"What in God's name is that thing?" The slender knight yells at you with a spear keeping distance. The other knight is noticeably stumbling with his spear swaying.

> Ask Anrial to convince

"Wait wait! Don't hurt us! We are leaving! We mean no harm. I'm uhhh actually throwing this monster out of here"
Horace looks back at her but doesn't say anything. The twins giggle. The slender knight keeps his spear on you where he then speaks.
"Well thank you for keeping monsters out. We can take it from here."
"Uhh actually we can handle it."
The soldier tries to interject except the drunk soldier falls over.
"Fine, you can lead that... Thing out of here. You are stupid to not kill it when we could gut it here.
The soldiers stay out to watch you all leave. You can faintly hear them ask how does the creature take commands. Anrial sighs a breath of relief while Isik says that we could have taken them if we wanted to. You try your best to talk back to Isik to remind him you are making orders but you cannot speak still. Your mouth is flooded is mushrooms with your blistered, bumpy tongue not allowing any decipherable noises. Isik looks disgusted. Anrial steps away. However the twins has an idea.
"Ooh how about we play doctor and cut those ugly things from your mouth! We know how to use a knife!"
They get near you with their knives out. You instinctively back away. Anrial looks at them and then back at you.
"It's for the best, you can't talk like that and we kinda need you.
> Trust the twins

You are out of town on the road. You find a look around somewhere for the operator to take place but you couldn't find a suitable place so you just lay in the ground with the ground twins hovering over you. They look at each other with glee in their eyes. Anrial does not want to watch so she looks away however Isik comes over and holds your head down. His nails dig into a mushrooms causing you pain. The twins open your mouth with there hands and they immediately recoil. Spores spew out even without you coughing or speaking. They may not be able to do this operation but they continue anyways. One of the holds your mouth open and takes your tongue out while the other tries to operate. You can't see what they are doing but you can definitely feel the pain of your tongue being sliced. You are not even sure if you can feel the mushrooms getting cut or it is your meaty tongue getting cut. No try to move your head around but Isik holds you still. Anrial reluctantly tries to comfort you by rubbing your shoulder but you can't even feel that. You can feel lumps drop into your mouth. This pain is agonizing, you aren't sure if they are trying to hurt you or actually help. This goes on for several long minutes before they stop and Isik lets go of your head. You get up and spit out a pile of fungus onto the ground with some blood. You curse at them saying that it really hurt but you notice you can speak a lot better now however they would need to really listen to hear you. The twins look happy and slightly apologetic. You aren't sure how to feel about them ruining your mouth but you get the very distinct feeling that it could have gotten worse (wink) but you have to take a rest to continuously gargle and spit water and to relax through the pain. While you are doing this, the party converses with each other. Isik looks at you and speaks with his gravely voice.
"Suppose e' go there and meet this bunch. What then smart man? We are no army fighting an undead one at that. We got a lady who's talent is to mix drinks, two new doctors who can't read, you who do no know whether to go left or right and me who is eh following you and watching you be stupid. We ain't fighting this lot!"
> Try to speak

Horace explains that we have magic and we can easily take out an army. Isik laughs.
"HA! You are a riot. You may have paid me off but I can assure you I will not be going on a su * cide mission unless I got a clear plan, aye? I'll help you along the way but when we get to... wherever we are going, I am not helping you. It may be fun to see Nodok get conquered."
You shake your head, despite having your titled ripped from your name, you still care about Nodok... right?
> Make a plan to find better magic

You told Isik that you have a good plan already so he listens. You explain that you know you may not have the greatest magic so you will look for better ones that we can use. Isik looks at you confused.
"You don't even know how to use your original gem thing right now and you are asking for more?"
Isik sighs and stands up straight.
"Get up. Do you even know how to fight? Let's fight off then."
Paul and Saul eagerly sits a few meters away to watch what will happen. Anrial reluctantly stands back with the twins to watch what will happen but is scared to see any violence among party members.
> Fight with your sword

You take out your long sword and feel the grip of it. Isik takes out his short sword and points it at you to feel the distance. Clearly you have an advantage over distance but he can swing faster if he gets in close to you. Saul happily watches the soon to be fight and tries to start it already.
"Go go! Fight!"
And so you both fight, you take a swing at Isik and he tries to defend himself by using his sword to clash with yours. Your weight and strength over powers him and he kneels to the floor. He looks for an opening while you continue the pressure. Unfortunately for him, his sword falls and you hit his chest with the butt of your handle, sending him further to the ground. You think he would be finished there but he has the strength to get up and to catch you off guard. He hits you at the thigh using the blunt side of the sword where the armor is ripped due to the fungus infection ripping your armor, rendering it useless. You almost stumble down to his level but manage to stay up. You see Isik breathing heavily and holding his chest but luckily he gets up. He looks at you in disapproval.
"You got me good but don't think because an enemy is down, they are not out, aye? We both hit each other and might I say, you hurt me a wallop."
Despite his disapproving gaze, he seems satisfied. You may have trouble on your own but with a party, maybe things won't be so bad.
You look up at the sky and see that it is starting to get near evening. You don't want to camp outside so maybe there is a town nearby that you can settle in. The members you sat down get up. Anrial checks up on Isik but he brushes her off. You look at the roads as you move and it split into two other roads. While you were deciding which one it is, Paul tapped on your shoulder.
"What's with this ugly dirt path?"
Sure enough, you see a dirt path that looks barely used. It might lead to a cabin or to someone's house that doesn't live in Nodok. You know that one of them leads to a town but you aren't sure which one it is but it is more likely it will be the main stone path.
> Take the left path

Anrial looks at you and asks you a question.
"Where do you think we should go?"
You tried speaking but gave up after sounding like a fool due to the mushrooms in your mouth still. You will need to practice on that but anyways you pointed to the left. Isik shrugs and the twins follows right behind you. You walk through the stone path where it slowly turned into dirt. Either it is still being worked on or it is forgotten about. You all take the occasional break for resting and other human functions but you make it to a large ruined tower on its side. It doesn't even look destroyed but instead it looks like it was made to look like that.  No rubble anywhere or trees destroyed. There are small lanterns leading to the door... that is sideways. The twins exclaim how awesome to see this while the two more grownups are unsure what to make of this.
> Knock on the door

You look back at your party and see Isik walking around the place, studying the design. Anrial shrugs and suggests opening the door. Before you were able to, a bright blue light started to shine through the cracks of the building, filling up the area with blue. Everyone takes out their weapons before the light disappears. Nobody moves until Saul walks to the door and knocks on it. Nobody answers. You open the door and come face to face to a large axe. The next thing you know is that you were on the floor with Isik on top of you.
"My God, you need to be more careful. This place is not for us. We need to leave."
You look over to the side of Isik and see that the axe is stuck to the doorframe.
> Continue inside

You got back up and dusted yourself off, more like cleaning off the mushrooms coming out of you. You look at the axe hanging from the ceiling with the twins picking at it, probably thinking on using it. No matter, you persist inside the sideways tower which is more like a tunnel with doors. You head on inside and immediately see arrows stuck on a pile of something. You inspect closer and see it is a body with the Nodok symbol on it. Despite your loyalty to Nodok being questioned, you still feel ill seeing someone from Nodok being killed to a trap like this. You look around more and see books scattered on the floor. The environment seems to be physics defying as there is a couch sitting in the ceiling like it is the floor and tables on the walls.  You see a door on the roof that is too high for anyone to climb. There anything for you to climb on. You try to grab the table on the wall but it seems to be glued on there.
How do you wish to get up there? You can ask for more details.
> Move the bookshelf

You pull the bookcase towards you then upwards. so it would be right under the door you are trying to get to. You try to climb on it but because of the gravity force going towards the ground, you pull it back to the floor when you climb on it.
You try to climb up it anyways and get close to the door but you cannot touch the handle.
> Get the glue off the table

You take your swords and start to scrape under the legs of the table. Amazingly, it isn't actually stuck to the wall and falls down to your floor you are standing on.
> Slide the bookshelf up the wall again then slide the table under where the bookshelf is

You slide the bookcase up once again and put the table underneath it. It looks like it is enough height to reach the door. The party members looked shocked you are coherent enough to solve this puzzle. You begin your climb onto the table, up the bookcase, using it as a ladder and make it to the door. You open it and immediately almost get blinded as blue light glows all around the room. The objects start moving and you panic. You jump to the the door and pull yourself up. The force of you jumping cracks the wooden boards of the bookcase. The couch falls to the ground, covering Saul underneath it. The chandelier leans to the roof, hitting itself against the wall. The table this time gets stuck on another wall, this time probably from whatever is causing this.
Paul and Anrial pulls the couch off Saul. He looks okay but he sits down. Isik looks around, trying to defend himself in case anything falls on him. He looks up at you.
"We aren't going up that way! Do you see something that can help us?"
You look around and see... what appears to be an ordinary room except for the fact that the furniture are stuck to the roof and walls how it was downstairs if you can call it downstairs. The bed is on the floor, a clothing cabinet is on the ceiling. A weirdly long lantern hands from the walls going to the other wall. You can see an empty pot next to you and more books scattered. More strange holes are on the walls still. There is another door but it is on the right wall this time.
> Look in a hole

Horace peaks through the hole and sees something pointy and shiny inside. You cannot reach inside of them.
> Ask the party to search the body

You look down at the door and check on your party. They all seem to be gathered around Saul talking to him but you get their attention. You ask them to loot the corpse. Anrial immediately interjects.
"Looting the dead? And a knight from Nodok? I know we hired criminals but really do this in front of people?"
Sual and Paul look at each other while Isik stares at you.
> LOOT THE DEAD

You heard Anrial mutter something but the criminals don't notice. They checked the body and found nothing of use that they could get. They did take the arrows out at give them to Anrial where she reluctantly takes. Isik looks up at you and speaks.
"The armor is penetrated by the arrows and I can't find a weapon. Sorry, aye-."
Paul interrupts the conversation.
"Oi we found a note here... I can't read for me dad."
Isik rips the note out of Paul's hand and reads it.
"It looks like an order for the Nodok's Knights to search this place for a mage of some kind. They don't like how there is a mage so close to Nodok even though personally that is stupid since he is outside of Nodok."
> Check the books

Horace asks the party tto check out the books downstairs while you read the books upstairs. They didn't understand you but you think they got it. They checked through the books scattered. You open a book and cough from dust and spores. It looks like runes of some kind. It definitely isn't any language that you know of. You wouldn't even know how to pronounce them. You heard Anrial yell up to you.
"We can't understand them! Probably some magic language!"
> Grow a mushroom vine with our fungus magic for our party to climb up

You hold out the fungus gem and think very hard about growing a vine. You look up at the ceiling and see nothing. You cough again which you thought was spores but it was a green thick line coming out of your mouth.
> Check out the next door

You decide to risk it and look into the next room. When you got near the bed, you hear a strange sword slice noise. The door pounds every time you heard that slink noise.
> Grab the lantern and try forcing it down the door on the floor to let our party climb up

It didn't work.
> Tie the pot to the lantern to weight it downwards

You grab the pot and the long lantern. You wrap the lantern around the pot and slowly slide it downwards. It still won't go down but it does curve a little downwards. Maybe it is because the pot isn't heavy enough to counter the force of sideways gravity?
> Grab the lantern and then jump down with it to allow the party to climb up

You pull the lantern back up and unwrap the pot. This time you will be going down.  You threw the lantern back down where it sway to the walls downstairs. You grab the chainand slowly lower yourself down. You are not going to the walls but instead to the ground where it safely takes you down. Once again, the members are shocked you managed to do this by yourself with the state of mind and body you have. They all immediately begin to climb up the chain while you hold it. Anrial holds you for a moment before going up the chain. They all manage to get up before you climb up there. Lucky that the chain was sturdy enough to hold you. You are all now at the upstairs room.
> Open the door VIOLENTLY

You jump on the bed to get near the door. You get close to the door and feel it pound against the hinges. It gets hit so hard that it is crazy that the door doesn't fall out like that. You get into position and place your leg near the doorknob. You reel back then kick it open. You are immediately stabbed by a large spike into your stomach. You cry out from the sharp pain and immediately recoil. You fall back to the bed and hold your stomach. The spike continues to extend until it hits next to where the lantern is positioned.
> Attempt to use fungus crystal to create a vine to the lever and pull it

You sit up on the bed and watch the pole retract and hit the wall. You watch the blood soak your new bandage on your belly. You try to make that vine appear again by holding out that gem and thinking harder this time about the vine to the lever. All that happens is that vine coming out of your mouth gets slightly longer.

> Welp, better call Saul!

You tell Saul that we should sue this place. He stares at you confused on what you meant
> Ask Anrial to shoot the lever

You look at Anrial and ask her to use her arrows to hit that switch. Isik chuckles and tells her to go for it. She takes out her bow and aims it at the lever. She waits for the spear to go back into the room before trying to shoot the lever. She shoots... a spear from the ceiling stops it. She shoots again, it missed and hit the wall. She shoots again, she hits under the lever. She shoots again, she hit the lever but it doesn't come down. She continues to shoot at it until it snaps from the constant bombardment of arrows and it turns off the machine.
> Practice using the gem

You hold out the gem once more... You think about creating a mushroom. You imagined a fungus growing in your mind. You felt something on your arm sting. You look and see a large mushroom growing from your arm.
> Try to make a vine appear once again

You are getting frustrated at not getting the results you want so you try to think about a vine once more. You imagined a vine dangling off the doorway in front of you. You hear a scream. You look back and see Saul holding out his hand to show a vine growing off it. He immediately cuts it off and rubs his arm where it was. 
> Head to the next room

You all watch your steps as you enter the next room. Scared at what you will find this time you listened closely. You can hear mumbling through the room.
> Open the door tactically

You all tread carefully to the door. The spikes don't go up again but you are still careful. Because the door is on the floor, you have to crouch to open it. But you don't want to open it and check, you want to head right in. You tell your team to get ready to pour in. Isik and Anrial share doubt but the twins are happy with this notion. You stand on the door, squat then jump as high as you can, smashing the door as you drop through.
You fall with a good landing with the rest of the team jumping in besides Isik who just watches from above. What you find here is... a study room and someone who is in a bathrobe. He is a very old man who looks like you could make him fall by breathing on him but he holds out his hand with something in it like he could kill you if he wanted to. The old man yells out at you and the party holds out their weapons.
"STOP RIGHT THERE OR YOU WILL BE TURNED TO ASH!"
> Play dumb

You decided to play dumb and say that you didn't know someone lived here.
"Oh yeah! I'm sure you going through my things on the way here means no one lives here. What the do you think the traps are for? Animals?!"
He shifts around the place and looks something behind him.
> Say that the tower looked abandoned

You tell that man that it looked abandoned how the tower looked fallen and that no man could live in a place like this. The old man stutters.
"W-well there could have been homeless people living here even if it looks abandoned- what do you want with this place anyways? Are you from Nodok?"
> Take out the King's scroll

You take out your scroll slowly. The old man stares at your hand and grips whatever is in his hand so tight, his hand turns white. You unscroll the paper and show it to him. Immediately, the old man is angry.
"I WILL NOT BE ARRESTED BY NODOK! THIS IS MY LAND! NOT YOURS! THIS IS MY MAGIC! YOU WILL DIE!"
The party looks at you for guidance.
> Say we're not here to arrest him

You felt your body heating up. You patted your arm as a fire bursts onto your mushrooms. You quickly spoke to the mage that you aren't here to arrest him. You look to the party and they are panicking as well as Anrial's hair is on fire. You quickly took out the flames and told him that you are travelers from Nodok, not soldiers. He continues to glare at you but soon your body felt cooler. "Who are you then!? Speak! I did not wish to be disturbed and you are here breaking down my things!"
> Convince: "we are just travleres, looking to unfungus ourselves?"

"You... you are human? I thought they decided to enlist a monster to get me. I apologize for my rude behavior. Nodok wishes to imprison me for practicing magic. Yes, I can help you with fixing your body."
You show the gem to the old mage. You thought he would have laughed like the gang in Nodok did when they gave it to you but instead he looked serious. He places something in his pockets and holds out his hand.
> Give the gem

You felt a piece of your soul leave when you gave the gem to the mage. He takes it forcibly then leaves to the back of the room on a desk with a book open.
You felt minutes go by with him reading the book, taking out books, putting books back in.
"What gem is this?"
> Tell him the truth

You told him it was a fungus gem you tried to use. He nods his head like he heard this before and went back to reading. He asks more questions and you answer them truthfully. He spins around.
"How did this happen to you? Did you do this to yourself on purpose because this doesn't just happen on accident."
> Truth | We did it ourselves

You followed Isik to the back of the building where you see him still moving and looking around the corners. He looks back and readies his sword but lets down.
"They got Paul and Saul."
> What happened and where

Isik rubs his face. You can tell he doesn't know what to do.
"I DONT KNOW! One of them was hurt by that angry blacksmith guy and had a hard time moving and the other was carrying him and I was trying to push past them but they got lost. I looked back and saw them forcing their mouths open to drink from that cup. I don't know where they are. I DONT KNOW ANY PLAN! Uh uh, the plan is to run away from this place!"
> Agree with your plan

You decide to leave the fates of the twins to the town.
You, Isik, and Anrial ran over to where you entered this palce and saw it still filled with those six guards from earlier. Isik expresses his doubts.
> Flee

The now smaller team runs through the town to look for another exit but finds any possible exits to be closed off by barricades, gates, or guards. All while they sneak past the somehow growing population of people.
> Fungi spore the air in the town

You held the team back and decided to try to send spores everywhere. Your paw unhinges but fully falls off. I'm sure that won't be a problem. You shot out spores but not enough to do any damage to the town, just to people individually.
> Tell isik and anrial to run to uhmm

"What about Saul and Paul?"
> "What are we gonna do against a whole town!?"

Isik interjects
"What if we um..."
"I'm thinking"
"What if we hide somewhere and leave when it is night through the guard area? And maybe we um... we find the twins and take them away from here?"
> "Are you sure they arent.. brainwashed already??"

Anrial  is bawling at this point, covering her eyes. Isik continues to talk.
"WE DONT KNOW THAT! What if they still need to do something like a uhhhh... ritual? Or maybe it takes a while or maybe we can reverse it or- We need to get them."
He is covering both sides of his head with his hands.
"I don't even know a good spot here."
> Hide in abandoned building

Isik looks around the corner then immediately backs off. 
"I'm looking for a place to be safe in."
He continues looking around the corner when into an alleyway when suddenly he gets his sword out. A man holding a cup of... juice walks towards you. Isik is hiding on a wall while the man is focused on you. Isik then smacks the temple of the man using the handle of the sword, immediately crippling him.
"We need to be careful"
> Follow Isik

The team followed behind Isik while he moved in the alleyway. He see him looked out in the open of town and waited for a few moments. You suspect he is watching for a good chance to get across town. You wait for a minute or so while you watch a crowd of people walk past down the street. Then Isik waves his hand over. He runs across the street where you and Anrial follows him. This might take a while if you need to get somewhere far but luckily there are abandoned buildings everywhere that are assumingly because of the cult like people. Isik continues to lead through the alleyways and small streets when they find a small group of people staring down an alleyway while holding a torch. You don't know what they are doing. Occasionally someone from the street will say hello then they will say hello back.
> Sneak past

You tried to sneak past them. Hopefully they won't notice your presence. Being in the city is bad but you cannot find a way out of here. Hopefully having higher ground will give you more information. You make it to an abandoned two story building that looks like a store. The doors and windows are boarded up so you have to break off a window barricade to get it in side the front entrance is too dangerous. There doesn't seem to be much in here save for a few items that aren't worthy to take but this can be your temporary camp.
> Barricade this place more

You pushed shelves over windows, pressed tables over doors, you found a giant pot and found liquid in there but decide to push it against a window.
> Go upstairs

Isik continues to push furniture, chairs, and tables to the windows and doors, you and Anrial went upstairs. It reeks of death up here. You aren't sure what you will find up here but it might be something good. As you walk upstairs, you almost slip. There is a dark oozing liquid pouring down. You aren't sure what to make of this. You got to the top and see a door with a pool of liquid pouring from underneath. You tried the door knob and it seems to be unlocked.
> Gently open it

Afraid that you might fight, you want to sneak your way inside. You slowly open the door and get hit by a wave of smells. You almost throw up but manage to keep your food in your stomach. The rooms is incredible but at the end of the room is disgusting. There is a man at the end of the room sitting down with his mouth open with a glowing green liquid coming out from his mouth. The man is wearing a robe with circular spectacles. 
> Look at the dead man

You pushed the head of the dead man. The liquid coming from his mouth wouldn't stop flowing. You felt like you were being watched. You don't know how this man died but whatever it is really messed him up. He look at his face...
His eyes moved to look at you.
> Look around

Creeped out by the man, you look around the place and notice it filled with flasks containing fluids inside of them. Some of them fell to the floor and mix together. That's what the mysterious ooze going downstairs is.
[...]



You clapped as hard as you can. Isik groggily gets up. The twin's head knock into each other
Martin stands up straight. Anrial quickly closes her journal
> Go to Gillerd

You told everyone you are going back to Gillerd. Isik groans and the twins goes back to sleep.
Martin however asks: "Isn't th-that b-back where you c-came from?"
You, still in fungal monster form, shook them around like a ragdoll until they fully wake up.
Everyone is up and ready to leave.
> Become human and head straight to Gillerd

You tried feeling your gem on your right arm but remembered you still don't have a left arm so you just had to focus without touching it
You did go back to human form but it did take a couple of minutes of pure thinking.
When you came back to human form, you see everyone is ready to go now. You all climbed through the window and walk to the exit of Wult back to Gillerd. 
Ah, the great hilly forest. What a beautiful place. The twins and Martin have trouble moving up the hills but besides that, everything is fine... for now.
You felt like you were being watched.
You swear you saw something move through the trees. Must've been your imagination...
You heard whatever it was, slithering around. You heard a loud hissing sound.
Is that what you think it is... or something else?
You thought about turning into a fungus while moving but find it hard to do so
You have to stand still to do it... something was staring at you

You take the time to skin the snake. As you are not an expert Hunter, you botch it badly but considering the amount of skin you can work with, you can get some usability. You folded, and stabbed through parts of the snake skin. It looks pretty bad but you got a torso snake shirt for Martin.
