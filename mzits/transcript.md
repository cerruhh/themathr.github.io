# Medieval Zombie ITS   
You are a knight who received this titles after fending off bandits that were scheming to rob a few houses in this town. You live to serve the kingdom and her citizens. However today may be different job than you are used to. You wake up early in the morning to hear a sound of a knocking on your door. You hear the birds chirping and the neighbors blabbering so nothing seems to be amiss. You open the door to find someone special. The Duke of the King, someone who advises him in his most important work. You listen to him closely.   
"Apologies to the rude awakening but the King and the Nodok's citizens has asked for your help. There is a problem occuring outside our perimeter that we cannot legally interfere with but we have alarm that there is an army brooding beyond. We cannot ask any of our higher nobles to help with your battle officially due to any higher seen nobles fighting beyond the Nodok's perimeter may be seen as expanding it. This will cause a feud between our allies and neutrals so we ask of you who is in lower nobility and that we can still trust. His Majesty has officially ordered you to fight this coming army and whether you win or lose, we appreciate your service."   
And after finishing, he hands your a scroll with the King's official orders then leaves without another word.   
How will you create your party?   
> Finding mercenaries around town   
   
The first place you could think of that will help you is finding mercenaries around town. Despite this being a peaceful kingdom, no kingdom is without criminals, the underlings, those who will do anything for money. And money that you have, being a knight pays well however you may not have that much compared to what other mercenaries get paid. You walk into the castle barracks to get your suit of armor, you have to look legitimate if you want to impress those who will be by your side. You notice a tavern on your way to the castle that you may want to visit.   
As you put on your armor, you notice the other knights getting ready this early. Too late to ask for help now, maybe. Your shining armor and your sword will intimidate anyone who thinks otherwise if you. You leave the barracks to the tavern. It is in the nice part of town so you don't think you will find much here but you can try. You open the doors wide and everybody glares at you, surprised. You see some shady individuals immediately begin to get up and walk away to the back of the store.   
Who will you invite to your party?   
> Announce invitation for mercenaries   
   
You walk to the middle of the room. Everybody looks at you as you go there. You clear your throats. You realize that you do not want to incriminate the King in anyways so you chose your words carefully.   
"To those who believe that there is evil in the world that they must get rid of, this is an official invitation to follow me towards the end of the kingdom and farther to defend your families. This is not an order of the King but this is an order from the ones you love. To those who will join me, stand up and stand next to me. You will be a hero to yourselves and to everybody else."   
Everybody looked dumbfounded as you said this and looked around. Some people blushed and walked out of the tavern. Some people stared at their food and drinks and not dare to look up.   
What happens now?   
> Wait for anyone to join   
   
(A mysterious crow with a top hat flew down from the heavens and gave them fungus)   
You continues to wait for anyone to join but it seems like nobody will join. You decide to wait at the bar and to get a drink. You can see the bartender sweat as they give you some ale without asking you what you want. You decide to take it anyways as it is probably because they don't want to get forced to join in. You look around the tavern once again and notice some people looking at you before looking down again. This is starting to get frustrating. You finish the ale, put some copper coins and leave. But as you leave the tavern, you hear someone behind you. It is a young, short adult female with orange hair. It's the bartender who just gave you money.   
"Um, what's going to be the fight?"   
You explain that you can say what it is but it will be important. She stares at the door to the tavern and back at you.   
"I'll join you. I need the money but most of all, the glory."   
Next step   
> Find criminals to help   
   
Realizing it may be harder to find companions than you initialize thought, you decide the next part is to find criminals. They may not fight for His Majesty but they will fight for money. The more you walk in the slums, you can feel the stench of the rotten fill your lungs. The walkways crack, the houses skew. As much as you love the kingdom, there is always part of the place that isn't beautiful. You find what you are looking for. Laws in place forbid you to break into a home without warrant of some kind but everybody knows this place is infested with criminals. It is a hideout of some kind. You try to open the door, it is locked. You knock on the door, nobody answers. You peak through boarded windows and see people looking back at you. The door opens, and you see what it looks like to be a dad and his sons waiting in the house.   
"Yeah? What do you want? I got nothing and we ain't do anything."   
How do you answer?   
> Invite with money   
   
You say nothing and have them a bag of coins. They say nothing and shake the bag, and look inside it then close the door.   
The bartender named Anrial that you learned from walking here shows her suspicion of recruiting bad people to our group.    
"Do you really think they can be trustworthy? They already got their money, what if they kill us?"   
You ponder that before the door opens against. The man gestures you go in. Anrial outright refuses to go in so you go in alone. What you see is a group of men sitting at a table. The presumed dad and his two sons and two other gentlemen. They gesture you to come closer. You are outnumbered and you aren't allowed to recruit criminals so if your body was found, if it was found, it would be dismissed as a crook. You walk to the table and see a map on what it looks like to be the slums. One of the older man looks at you.   
"Which house do you want broken or you lookin' for us to off a man and 'is wife."   
The man points to a random house while he talks. You just point to the outside of the kingdom. He shakes his head.   
"We ain't do stuff like that shiny. Now get out heh."   
How do you answer?   
> Convince: "Gents, i'd also pick the house, under normal circumstances anyways. However, this quest outside the kingdom is a quest from the king himself. The pay will be nice, and since this whole ordeal is sorta under wraps, he may even grant us a pardon from our crimes. C'mon, whaddya say? The choice is yours as well, by the way."    
   
They all look at each other. The gentleman who spoke to you gestured you to move away. They all spoke in whispers. Despite being in armor, you feel afraid on what a group of lowlifes will say to you. One of them reached behind their back and placed a dagger on the table. The rest follows through. One of the men who you thought to be a son of the dad looked at you teary eyed.   
"I've... I've done some bad things in the past. Things I don't want to do anymore. Things that still haunt me. I killed me mum. God will never forgive me but is it true that the King will?"   
You look at the young man with a tear dripping down his cheek. You say to the young man that his life will get better from here and will start a new. Of course you don't know that the King will authorize this. They are lowlife scum that deserve to be put to death for what they done but right now, they are important. He perks right up.   
"I'll join then."   
The other presumed son gets up as well.   
"Me too."   
The older gentleman with scars on his face gets up too.   
"Aye."   
You nod your head and walked straight out the door.   
What now?   
> Leave the kingdom   
   
As you walked out the door, you see Anrial talking to who appears to be the Duke. He looks at you sternly.    
"I will not argue with who you bring but there is something we need to discuss. Follow me to my room."   
The criminals looked at the other member you have and smiles. Anrial moves closer to you.   
You all walked to the castle. It is a grand beautiful stone and marble creation built by the servants of God and His Majesty. The grand door opens to show the hall. You go upstairs to the right into the dukes room. As an advisor to the King, it is looks a lot like the room for a king.   
"I have important information I didn't disclose. You will be going to fight near our allies' kingdom of Pomm. They did not wish to help us out due to troubles we already have from before. Our situation is strained. We cannot show that a group from our kingdom fighting that army. Your armor and weapon? I'm sorry about this but we cannot give you our official armory but you have to get your own. Sorry not, we will give you five gold pieces in order to pay for any armor and weapons you wish for."   
Where do you go?   
> Armor shop   
   
(plant a mushroom?)   
You first walked into the barracks to take off your armor and your weapon. The other knights stationed looked at you weirdly as you would be leaving off shift but it's fine.   
As you all walk to the armor shop. The gentleman who you now know as Isik explains that the guy who knows magic is somewhat feared by other criminals and tend to make other people go away. You pondered on that as you entered the shop. A flat faced looking man happily greats you. He shows you around the place. These aren't on par with the armor at home but they seem decent. You look at the things your party has.   
   
Anrial - Cloth Armor   
Isik - Hide Armor   
Paul - Hide armor   
Saul - Hide Armor   
   
Shop    
Padded armor - 5 G   
Leather armor - 3 G   
Chainmail - 7 G   
Scale armor - 8 G   
Chain shirt - 6 G   
Wood shield - 8 G   
Knight Armor - 20 G   
   
You have 22 G   
> Buy padded armor   
   
The flat faced shopkeeper brings out a stuffed piece of armor. It is better than clothing and it feels comfy to wear. You inspect your body all around and see that it fits quite well. You hand over the pieces of gold to the shopkeeper and leave on your way. Anrial notices your new shirt.   
"You know, it's good that you at least bought something. Going out there with just your straps would be a pain."   
> Go back and buy a shield   
  
You go back in and the shopkeeper is surprised. He was busy staring at the gold pieces when you came in. He quickly put them away and showed the armor. You sheepishly grab the wooden shield and give him 8 pieces of gold as well. He looks ecstatic. You leave and follow Isik to that supposed friend he has who knows about magic.   
> Follow Isik for the guy who knows magic   
   
You knock on the door to no reply. You knock again to no reply. You knock thrice then a large burly man opens the door. He appears to be wearing the armor of the castle. He immediately stops you and forces you back with a spear.   
"HALT! Under orders of His Majesty, this house sanctioned to be housing the Knights of Nodok. Who goes there!"   
> Convince the guard: "I apologize... I haven't properly introduced to thyself. I'm Horace K.D."   
(name set to Horace Krispy Dinglebert)   
   
You announce. You strike a pose similar to the one the guard is doing. The burly man slightly lowers his posture then looks around.   
"I... I don't know who you are. I never once heard of you. Are you like some celebrity or something?"   
You saw Anrial and Isik both facepalming but still with you regardless.   
> "Yes, you haven’t heard of us? Part of the elite guard, not that you’d know about us"   
   
The knight lowers his shoulders and just looks at you embarrassed. He looks behind himself to look at something then outside the place to see your party standing there.   
"Uh, Elite guard? They don't exist... Right? You don't look like a guard. You don't even have a weapon or some metal armor. The people next to you look more guard like than you. Look sir, the doctor is around the corner and can help you."   
> Bring out the scroll saying we're undercover   
   
You sigh and bring out the scroll of His Majesty. You read through it and to make sure there is a signature on the paper and indeed there is on the King, Queen, and the Duke. The guard looks at it and begins to immediately bring out his spear once again. He swore at your face.   
"You guys know of this place? I'll die before I let them find out what we do- what- what I do!"   
On second thought, maybe bringing in the King's orders on a place Isik says may have the King under his belt is not the greatest idea especially since magic is forbidden and there is a knight here.   
> ACT ==> Say we want to join them   
   
You have nothing to defending yourself so all you could do is to ready your hands. Your party besides Isik rushed towards your side and immediately ready their weapons. The guard stares at your sternly. You try to quickly explain that you aren't here to bring him down but you want to join in. You brought out your scroll again and the Knight reads it at the top of his spear underlining the words. He stands quiet for a moment.   
"They ripped you of your armor and weapons? They always send us on suicide missions. That's why I'm with the boss here instead of being stationed out there." He looks at the scroll and back at you. "Fine. You can come in but if you do anything fishy. I'm gutting you and myself. I got to speak with the boss." He closes the door and so you wait patiently reluctantly. After several minutes he comes back and allows you to come in.   
You go into the grand house. It is nothing like the castle but it is remarking on its own. Custom made paintings fill the walls with double statues on either side that seem to follow you with their eyes. You continue to walk through the house until you find yourself at a living room of sorts. You find other people here who look very nice for someone who supposedly do bad things for a living. Even another knight. They glare at you, staring into your soul. The burly knight looks at your and your party.   
"You all need to wait here. Everybody else, disperse. We got someone who can fix our problem."   
They all leave without another word. The knight glaring at you snickered then follow the criminal group out.    
"Sorry about the delay. We don't want any undercover police coming here, no matter what their situation is. The boss don't want to talk to you so I will do. What do you want from us?"   
> Say that we want to learn magic   
   
You tell the burly knight that you are looking to study magic and hoping to accomplish something for your goal. He makes a noise with his mouth and flicks something on his shoulder.   
"I'm afraid... That's not something we sell. You... You would be right that we have magic but the boss has a couple of them uh magic gems? He doesn't just give them out. He only gives them to those that can prove themselves that they can use it and very loyal. Uh, anything else you want?"   
> Prove ourselves   
   
You stood up and tell the knight you are worthy to prove yourself. Saul and Paul also stood up for you. Anrial however hesitated.   
"I um... Not so sure about this? I thought we were doing this for the good of the uh Nodok Kingdom? I do not like this family."   
> Leave Anrial behind with Isik and wink at her to say we're not actually joining   
   
You turn your head to look at her. She looks pretty much afraid of this place. He gave her a little wink hopefully understanding what that means. She nods a bit but she doesn't seem fully convinced. Hopefully she will stay by you when the hard times come.   
"Excellent! You have to follow us then. And leave your weapons here."   
You leave your weapons as to continue this trust you want them to have. You go deeper into the building, going upstairs. You enter what looks like to be a conference room with someone wearing a mask and a robe at the end of the conference table.    
You sit down on at the closest chair along with your other party members sitting next to you. The masked man speaks in a gravely voice.   
"A Knight falling down the dark path to secure his future? I can show you the road with us if you would like. You have to follow us with arms tied together. What does the fallen say to us?"   
The knight who followed you nudged your arm. "He meant that metaphorically" The burly Knight coughs as he nudged your arm. "He is confusing at times"   
> Accept   
   
You say that you accept the invitation to join if that what you think he is saying.   
"Excellent. I have a proposal for you. The soon to be corpse in rusted armor next to you has failed his duties of bringing my princess back. They yanked her while we are silent in the night. Quick as a fox and silent as a mouse. Nobody wants to get her in fear of somehow causing more damage to me by damaging my prized possession. Bring back my trophy and I shall kiss you with a magic gem. Follow the residence of the Ulays and pluck their flaming wick from their bodies."   
You wanted to ask what that meant but before you could. The knight tapped your arm to signify that you should leave. You didn't want to overstay your welcome so you left. You walked back to the living room where it was still empty.   
> Ask the guard about the princess   
   
Horace asks the knight where is that princess his boss told him about.   
"Oh... That girl. Um, some 'good' Samaritans called the Ulays has her. They are in the regular part of town. Actually near the edge of the capital. Go around, look for a brick home with a little girl running around usually."   
> Go to a weapon store   
   
Considering what may lie in that house and what the boss wants you to do, you consider going to a nearby weapon store. You walk down the street with your party members Isik, Anrial, Saul, and Paul now following you. Isik stays far away from the group after the talk you guys had in the house. You reach inside the store to find a familiar looking flat faced man cleaning the weapons on the rack. Excited, he shows you around.   
   
Anrial - Short Wooden Bow   
Isik - Short Sword   
Paul - Dagger   
Saul - Double Daggers   
   
Double Daggers -  3 G   
Short Sword - 5 G   
Long Sword -  7 G   
War Hammer - 7 G   
Mace - 5 G   
Flail Mace - 7 G   
You have 22 G to spend   
> Buy the Long Sword   
   
You decide to buy the Long Sword for yourself. The shopkeeper greedily takes your 7 G and puts it in another bag. You leave the shop to find that Ulays residence. While you are walking to the edge of the town to find that place, Saul mentions that Isik now hates you before getting slapped by Paul. You didn't care to think about that for now but it would be good to remember that Isik is an old criminal with some grudges from all the years he lived. Besides thinking about that, you did reach the Ulays and sure enough, there are a couple of people living there and a little girl playing with a ball. They wave their hand expecting you to pass by but grow concern when you get closer to them.   
> Talk to the Ulays: "listen we have a plan to help you get revenge on the shadow wizard money gang we are going to bring your girl to them but then she stab the boss once she gets close to him and this will distract them so you can strike and then we have a magic gem and everyone is happy"   
   
You explain to these parents that you want to take down this gang that wants to take their child so you can get a gem. They look mortified.   
"Why would we want our kid to kill someone? And to take a magic gem? Isn't that magic thing against the law and you want us to join? This- this is madness! I-I should report you to the authorities right now!"   
> Take the kid and run   
   
After messing up on what you said, you get nervous and decide to just take the kid and bring her straight to the boss. You tell the party to stall the parents. You run to the kid, scoop her up and immediately begin running to the direction of the gang. The only thing you hear behind you is the screaming and of both sides fighting.   
The child in your arm doesn't seem to be crying and in fact just looks confused. In your mind, you are thinking of your Knight status that may be crumbling down if this goes bad. You come across a large open space full of people that is a market. It would be easy to go right through the place but there are a lot of guards around. You don't look that suspicious with the child not crying but you don't know about taking the chances.   
> Take a detour   
   
Not wanting to risk it, you decide to go into a nearby alley to slip past the markets. It goes into a winding pattern, making it hard to find where you are. You only know where you are because of what the castle looks like from angles but other than that you are lost. This goes on until you bumped into a patrolling guard, not a knight. You apologize to the guard but he stops you.   
"What's with the running. You can stop and talk to me. Are you in trouble?   
> Say "sorry we're late to an appointment"   
   
You quickly say to the guard that you are late for an appointment for your daughter. The child says nothing but just stares at the guard. You try to be more convincing by trying to go around him.   
"Oh sorry, you just looked like you needed some help."   
The guard let's you leave and you take the time to try to find that house again. It does take you a while but no other guard tries to stop you and you manage to find that house. You knock on the door with your foot and that burly looking Knight answers the door. He looks surprised to see you and gasped when he saw that kid. He quickly ushers you in.   
"How did you manage to get that kid without bringing attention to yourself. You know what, I don't care, give her to me."   
Having no other choice, you give the girl to the burly knight where he presumably brings to the boss. He didn't even leave you in the living room where he left you before, you are just in the main hall. Several minutes have passed when you hear knocking at the door. It was slow before getting faster and harder. Whoever is out there must be in trouble or just impatient.   
> Answer it   
   
You decide to open the door, expecting something bad but instead you find your party members at the other side of the door. Anrial, Saul, Paul, and Isik quickly go inside.    
"We tried to stop them but they manage to get the police on us. We manage to lose them easily but we had to help Anrial. That stupid girl almost killed us" Saul angrily said. Anrial looks down and says nothing.   
> Wait in silence   
   
You decide to stand in awkward silence with your party in this tense air. Anrial is standing near the door looking down while the twins and Isik are just staring right through her. You watch them just look at stare for what seems to be a long time until that burly knight appears again.   
"Alright he- am I interrupting something? I don't care actually, the boss wants to talk to you for doing this job."   
He leads you through the maze of rooms and hallways into that same conference room you met him in. You sit in the same chair as you did before with the twins sitting in their chairs. Anrial is standing near the door, not daring to sit and Isik is nowhere to be seen. The strange man at the other end begins to talk again.   
"Well done champion of the day. I have my beautiful daughter back from the nails of those disgusting frogs just licking up anything they see saying it is nature to do so. You are finally using your ears and mouth to what I am speaking unlike these idiots who can't tell what a goblin is to a miner. Now your reward! What do you desire for I am your genie for this moment."   
> FUNGUS MAGIC!!   
   
The strange man looks at you confused. If his head could rotate 180° he would. Anrial quickly apologizes for your eagerness and the twins are laughing.   
"I'm sorry, he just talks about fungus magic all day I'm not even sure if that is even a thing-"   
The hardened criminal boss laughs along with the knight.   
"You must be a witch if you already know about our secret stash of garbage. The community of us found a gem for fungus magic or something but it must be God's joke because we couldn't find a use for it. You can have it for free if you want along with something new."   
The party looks dumbfounded but Horace just smirks at everyone. He stops laughing immediately and just says he was half joking, you can get something else but don't expect much.   
> Ask for money   
   
The boss chuckles a little before continuing the coversation. The knight looks confused at you asking for more.   
"You already bought the 2G fungus gem for free and you want money? I didn't not say you could get more but you will get three gold pieces then. Want more treasure? You can stay with us like that idiot Erin there is staying as family."   
The knight leaves the room through the door next to the boss where he brings out a handful of gold pieces and a dark green gem. He places them on the table in front of you. You felt your happiness go through the roof with the new found fungus magic but you aren't sure how to use it. The boss shoos you out of the room and the Knight escorts you out of the house with no other thought. You find Isik waiting for you at the lobby with a new black eye. He doesn't say a word as he follows you out.   
You look at the sky and it seems to be getting dark. You should go back to your home after today. You have done a lot and tomorrow should be a good day to leave for your adventure. You look at your party.   
> Sleep together at your home   
   
You didn't feel like trying to find everybody again so you decide to all sleep together at your home. It's glamorous but it can do well. You decide to bring them close to the castle walls which your house is near. Everybody enters your house and everyone is amazed by it despite you not seeing it the same as them. Perhaps you taken it for granted that you live in luxury that other people do not. Whatever the case, you do have your own armor and weapon rack for training weapons but it can be used for your real weapon. You place your sword on the rack and everybody realizes they should do they same and so they do except for Isik. You show them around the place which the twins and Anrial showing excitement but Isik is just following along. You showed them your living room and an unused room and they could take. Isik immediately goes into the unused room and shuts the door. Saul, Paul, and Anrial takes the hint and just stays in the living room.   
> Try the fungus magic   
   
You go outside while everybody is conversing. You look around for a stick and find a few twigs. You decide to test your gem on them to try anything. You gently squeeze the gem and imagine fungus growing on the twigs. You wait for anything but nothing happens. You close your eyes and squeeze harder and wait for something to happen. You felt heat emanating from the gem and your hand getting warmer and fuzzier? You look down at the twigs and see a small mushroom growing from each of them with roots connecting them all togther. You look at the gem and much to your terror, you realize your hand is covered in mushroom. You tried to shake it off but nothing happens, they stay on.   
> Let it happen. Be the Knight of Fungi.   
   
You watch your hands grow mushrooms. It vigorously pulsates, spreading around up to your wrists. Despite your physical well-being being in critical condition, you felt ecstatic. Your felt your muscles and bones ache with the cancer of mushrooms growing through your skin and forcing itself out. Strangely though, you felt your senses heighten as you become one with yourself. You always wanted to feel as one person but with this many organisms inside of you, you finally found happiness of having any different minds inside of you. The parallels of your split personality and the many minds of fungus fascinates you. You didn't realize you were crying from pain but it soon subsided. You look down at yourself. It felt stiff to move and every move that you do is painful but you slowly grow number to it. The little armor that you once had seems to be worn down by the fungus growing through it. You doubt anything will be comfortable on you.   
Warning: all armor efficiency is decreased    
Higher chance of failure during combat   
Health is increased    
Natural fungus scale like armor is automatically applied   
> Sneak into your room   
   
Despite coming to terms with yourself, you didn't want the party or anyone else to see you like this. There should be a window to your room. You stumble over to your side of the house to find a locked window with window boards closing it from the inside. You try to pull it open but it won't butch. Your bumpy fingers does not allow you to grip well.   
> Walk through the front door   
   
You didn't want to break down your own property and you came to terms to how you look. You decide to go ahead and get it over with by walking through the front door. You open the front door with the night light shining through, you look like a monster. Anrial screams immediately while the twins focus on the weapon rack next to you. Isik comes rushing out with his sword and immediately curses.   
> Convince: "don't worry i'm fine"   
   
You try your best to say that you are fine to Isik but you just stumble over your words. You cough and spores comes out from your mouth, spraying the room with it. Isik backs off and waves his hand trying to push the spores away. He doesn't seem to understand you. You try to speak again more clearly.   
"What in the Lord's name is this monster! Horace get over here! I don't care if you are healthy, you are in our home!"   
Isik swings his sword towards you. You try to dodge and block at the same time with your arm but it ends up slicing your arm, cutting chunks of mushrooms off. Blood oozes from the mushrooms.   
> Write words with spores   
   
You hold the dark green gem in front of you and squeeze gently. Isik is taken back at the sight of this. The mushrooms protruding out of you releases more spores than usual. You try spelling out anything using them. They do move around but they don't make any decipherable words. They fall to the floor aimlessly. Isik takes another swing at you. This time you manage to dodge it by side stepping backwards. Where the spores fall, fungus is quickly created. You manage to spell out the words Horace using the mushrooms. You point down the floor where the mushrooms are for Isik to read. He instinctively looks at what you are pointing at.   
"My God, Horace? Is that you? A thousand apologies, I had no idea you turned into a ghoul. I saw the gem you were holding and got confused then I was thinking about what it did. Are you alright? We need to see a doctor right away."   
> Go to bed   
   
(name set to Horace Krispy Dinglebert the 3rd)   
Horace Krispy Dinglebert the 3rd waved off Isik. You didn't think you needed a hospital. In fact, you felt pretty good besides the wound you just had. You stumble past Isik and the rest of your party who now had weapons to your room. The door opens forcibly showing off your bedroom with a bookcase and small terrarium that is already full of mushrooms. Seems like you been obsessed with them before this adventure. The don't need any taking care of besides nutrients so you just throw some old food in there that was on your desk. You look at your bleeding arm. You notice that there was a small blood trail leading to where the fight occurred. You didn't care to fix this so you just wrap your arm with some cloth you found in the desk you had to stop the bleeding. You slowly pulled yourself onto your bed where it bends down from the newly acquired weight you have gotten. You fall asleep like this and wait for the new day.

25/17 HP   
You wake up to aggressive knocking on the door. It appears to be Anrial trying to wake you up. She talks through the door.   
"Um, the guy says he is the Duke and he is mad or something. I think it is important."   
You can hear her footsteps go quieter.   
> Talk with the Duke   
   
You felt a sense of dread thinking of everything you have done. You have done a lot of illegal things in the span of twenty four hours. You felt like you didn't think about the consequences of those actions, just the short term effects. You didn't even realize you were at the front door. You look around and everybody except Anrial is gone. You don't know where they went but it might be better if they weren't seen. You open the door to see the Duke of Nodok. The overweight man looks red with frustration. He stands back, shocked at what you look like but speaks.   
"Knight Horace, what have you done to the her kingdom and yourself? His Majesty is in shambles finding out a recently knighted man to turn dark. I was getting reports of your misdeeds the entire day yesterday. I had to verify them myself. Section Cain guards have told me that they say you were having discourse with criminals and were even friends with them! As a Knight you should know you should loathe them as they stain Nodok. And- and have you seen yourself?! You look like a creature we kill without mercy. If I hadn't known better, I would have immediately called for guards but I have heard you have gotten to use magic. Look at yourself, this is the reason why we don't use magic. You don't know how to use it. You could have killed someone! In fact I need to quarantine because I'm near you. But I'm too angry to stop yelling at you. Once you finish with this mission, your Knight status is being revoked. Do you have anything to say for yourself?"   
> Acknowledge what the Duke said   
   
After everything the Duke said to you, all the possible things you wish you could have said, you couldn't say it. You just said that you understood what he said and will continue on the mission. The Duke turns back and says a few more words after sighing.   
"Did you really do everything for your personal gain or to be a defender of Nodok?"   
He walks away. You close the door and look back to see Anrial being worried.    
"So what happens now? Are we leaving?"   
> Leave the kingdom onto your adventure   
   
(name set to Horace "the crumpled paper" Jean Krispy Dinglebert the 3rd)   
After a painfully long amount of time while you decide on that to do to the point Anrial was about to check up on you, you decided to leave Nodok and onto your adventure. The criminals exited the guest room as you were talking and they look ready. They had their armor and weapons ready taking it out of the weapon rack. You breathed in the fresh air with a hint of fungus and led your party to a road leading out of the kingdom. You passed by onlookers running away from your ragtag group of newly made criminals and a monster leading them. Leading out of the official territory where the houses are less, you found a small camp which had the Nodok symbol. A group of soldiers immediately came out as soon as they saw your group. They immediately ready their weapons. You get the feeling this will be a common occurrence.   
"What in God's name is that thing?" The slender knight yells at you with a spear keeping distance. The other knight is noticeably stumbling with his spear swaying.

"Wait wait! Don't hurt us! We are leaving! We mean no harm. I'm uhhh actually throwing this monster out of here"   
Horace looks back at her but doesn't say anything. The twins giggle. The slender knight keeps his spear on you where he then speaks.   
"Well thank you for keeping monsters out. We can take it from here."   
"Uhh actually we can handle it."   
The soldier tries to interject except the drunk soldier falls over.   
"Fine, you can lead that... Thing out of here. You are stupid to not kill it when we could gut it here.   
The soldiers stay out to watch you all leave. You can faintly hear them ask how does the creature take commands. Anrial sighs a breath of relief while Isik says that we could have taken them if we wanted to. You try your best to talk back to Isik to remind him you are making orders but you cannot speak still. Your mouth is flooded is mushrooms with your blistered, bumpy tongue not allowing any decipherable noises. Isik looks disgusted. Anrial steps away. However the twins has an idea.   
"Ooh how about we play doctor and cut those ugly things from your mouth! We know how to use a knife!"   
They get near you with their knives out. You instinctively back away. Anrial looks at them and then back at you.   
"It's for the best, you can't talk like that and we kinda need you.   
> Trust the twins   
   
You are out of town on the road. You find a look around somewhere for the operator to take place but you couldn't find a suitable place so you just lay in the ground with the ground twins hovering over you. They look at each other with glee in their eyes. Anrial does not want to watch so she looks away however Isik comes over and holds your head down. His nails dig into a mushrooms causing you pain. The twins open your mouth with there hands and they immediately recoil. Spores spew out even without you coughing or speaking. They may not be able to do this operation but they continue anyways. One of the holds your mouth open and takes your tongue out while the other tries to operate. You can't see what they are doing but you can definitely feel the pain of your tongue being sliced. You are not even sure if you can feel the mushrooms getting cut or it is your meaty tongue getting cut. No try to move your head around but Isik holds you still. Anrial reluctantly tries to comfort you by rubbing your shoulder but you can't even feel that. You can feel lumps drop into your mouth. This pain is agonizing, you aren't sure if they are trying to hurt you or actually help. This goes on for several long minutes before they stop and Isik lets go of your head. You get up and spit out a pile of fungus onto the ground with some blood. You curse at them saying that it really hurt but you notice you can speak a lot better now however they would need to really listen to hear you. The twins look happy and slightly apologetic. You aren't sure how to feel about them ruining your mouth but you get the very distinct feeling that it could have gotten worse (wink) but you have to take a rest to continuously gargle and spit water and to relax through the pain. While you are doing this, the party converses with each other. Isik looks at you and speaks with his gravely voice.   
"Suppose e' go there and meet this bunch. What then smart man? We are no army fighting an undead one at that. We got a lady who's talent is to mix drinks, two new doctors who can't read, you who do no know whether to go left or right and me who is eh following you and watching you be stupid. We ain't fighting this lot!"   
> Try to speak   
   
Horace explains that we have magic and we can easily take out an army. Isik laughs.   
"HA! You are a riot. You may have paid me off but I can assure you I will not be going on a su * cide mission unless I got a clear plan, aye? I'll help you along the way but when we get to... wherever we are going, I am not helping you. It may be fun to see Nodok get conquered."   
You shake your head, despite having your titled ripped from your name, you still care about Nodok... right?   
> Make a plan to find better magic   
   
You told Isik that you have a good plan already so he listens. You explain that you know you may not have the greatest magic so you will look for better ones that we can use. Isik looks at you confused.   
"You don't even know how to use your original gem thing right now and you are asking for more?"   
Isik sighs and stands up straight.   
"Get up. Do you even know how to fight? Let's fight off then."   
Paul and Saul eagerly sits a few meters away to watch what will happen. Anrial reluctantly stands back with the twins to watch what will happen but is scared to see any violence among party members.   
> Fight with your sword   
   
You take out your long sword and feel the grip of it. Isik takes out his short sword and points it at you to feel the distance. Clearly you have an advantage over distance but he can swing faster if he gets in close to you. Saul happily watches the soon to be fight and tries to start it already.   
"Go go! Fight!"   
And so you both fight, you take a swing at Isik and he tries to defend himself by using his sword to clash with yours. Your weight and strength over powers him and he kneels to the floor. He looks for an opening while you continue the pressure. Unfortunately for him, his sword falls and you hit his chest with the butt of your handle, sending him further to the ground. You think he would be finished there but he has the strength to get up and to catch you off guard. He hits you at the thigh using the blunt side of the sword where the armor is ripped due to the fungus infection ripping your armor, rendering it useless. You almost stumble down to his level but manage to stay up. You see Isik breathing heavily and holding his chest but luckily he gets up. He looks at you in disapproval.   
"You got me good but don't think because an enemy is down, they are not out, aye? We both hit each other and might I say, you hurt me a wallop."   
Despite his disapproving gaze, he seems satisfied. You may have trouble on your own but with a party, maybe things won't be so bad.   
You look up at the sky and see that it is starting to get near evening. You don't want to camp outside so maybe there is a town nearby that you can settle in. The members you sat down get up. Anrial checks up on Isik but he brushes her off. You look at the roads as you move and it split into two other roads. While you were deciding which one it is, Paul tapped on your shoulder.   
"What's with this ugly dirt path?"   
Sure enough, you see a dirt path that looks barely used. It might lead to a cabin or to someone's house that doesn't live in Nodok. You know that one of them leads to a town but you aren't sure which one it is but it is more likely it will be the main stone path.   
> Take the left path   
   
Anrial looks at you and asks you a question.   
"Where do you think we should go?"   
You tried speaking but gave up after sounding like a fool due to the mushrooms in your mouth still. You will need to practice on that but anyways you pointed to the left. Isik shrugs and the twins follows right behind you. You walk through the stone path where it slowly turned into dirt. Either it is still being worked on or it is forgotten about. You all take the occasional break for resting and other human functions but you make it to a large ruined tower on its side. It doesn't even look destroyed but instead it looks like it was made to look like that.  No rubble anywhere or trees destroyed. There are small lanterns leading to the door... that is sideways. The twins exclaim how awesome to see this while the two more grownups are unsure what to make of this.   
> Knock on the door   
   
You look back at your party and see Isik walking around the place, studying the design. Anrial shrugs and suggests opening the door. Before you were able to, a bright blue light started to shine through the cracks of the building, filling up the area with blue. Everyone takes out their weapons before the light disappears. Nobody moves until Saul walks to the door and knocks on it. Nobody answers. You open the door and come face to face to a large axe. The next thing you know is that you were on the floor with Isik on top of you.   
"My God, you need to be more careful. This place is not for us. We need to leave."   
You look over to the side of Isik and see that the axe is stuck to the doorframe.   
> Continue inside   
   
You got back up and dusted yourself off, more like cleaning off the mushrooms coming out of you. You look at the axe hanging from the ceiling with the twins picking at it, probably thinking on using it. No matter, you persist inside the sideways tower which is more like a tunnel with doors. You head on inside and immediately see arrows stuck on a pile of something. You inspect closer and see it is a body with the Nodok symbol on it. Despite your loyalty to Nodok being questioned, you still feel ill seeing someone from Nodok being killed to a trap like this. You look around more and see books scattered on the floor. The environment seems to be physics defying as there is a couch sitting in the ceiling like it is the floor and tables on the walls.  You see a door on the roof that is too high for anyone to climb. There anything for you to climb on. You try to grab the table on the wall but it seems to be glued on there.   
How do you wish to get up there? You can ask for more details.   
> Move the bookshelf   
   
You pull the bookcase towards you then upwards. so it would be right under the door you are trying to get to. You try to climb on it but because of the gravity force going towards the ground, you pull it back to the floor when you climb on it.   
You try to climb up it anyways and get close to the door but you cannot touch the handle.   
> Get the glue off the table   
   
You take your swords and start to scrape under the legs of the table. Amazingly, it isn't actually stuck to the wall and falls down to your floor you are standing on.   
> Slide the bookshelf up the wall again then slide the table under where the bookshelf is   
   
You slide the bookcase up once again and put the table underneath it. It looks like it is enough height to reach the door. The party members looked shocked you are coherent enough to solve this puzzle. You begin your climb onto the table, up the bookcase, using it as a ladder and make it to the door. You open it and immediately almost get blinded as blue light glows all around the room. The objects start moving and you panic. You jump to the the door and pull yourself up. The force of you jumping cracks the wooden boards of the bookcase. The couch falls to the ground, covering Saul underneath it. The chandelier leans to the roof, hitting itself against the wall. The table this time gets stuck on another wall, this time probably from whatever is causing this.   
Paul and Anrial pulls the couch off Saul. He looks okay but he sits down. Isik looks around, trying to defend himself in case anything falls on him. He looks up at you.   
"We aren't going up that way! Do you see something that can help us?"   
You look around and see... what appears to be an ordinary room except for the fact that the furniture are stuck to the roof and walls how it was downstairs if you can call it downstairs. The bed is on the floor, a clothing cabinet is on the ceiling. A weirdly long lantern hands from the walls going to the other wall. You can see an empty pot next to you and more books scattered. More strange holes are on the walls still. There is another door but it is on the right wall this time.   
> Look in a hole   
   
Horace peaks through the hole and sees something pointy and shiny inside. You cannot reach inside of them.   
> Ask the party to search the body   
   
You look down at the door and check on your party. They all seem to be gathered around Saul talking to him but you get their attention. You ask them to loot the corpse. Anrial immediately interjects.   
"Looting the dead? And a knight from Nodok? I know we hired criminals but really do this in front of people?"   
Sual and Paul look at each other while Isik stares at you.   
> LOOT THE DEAD   
   
You heard Anrial mutter something but the criminals don't notice. They checked the body and found nothing of use that they could get. They did take the arrows out at give them to Anrial where she reluctantly takes. Isik looks up at you and speaks.   
"The armor is penetrated by the arrows and I can't find a weapon. Sorry, aye-."   
Paul interrupts the conversation.   
"Oi we found a note here... I can't read for me dad."   
Isik rips the note out of Paul's hand and reads it.   
"It looks like an order for the Nodok's Knights to search this place for a mage of some kind. They don't like how there is a mage so close to Nodok even though personally that is stupid since he is outside of Nodok."   
> Check the books   
   
Horace asks the party tto check out the books downstairs while you read the books upstairs. They didn't understand you but you think they got it. They checked through the books scattered. You open a book and cough from dust and spores. It looks like runes of some kind. It definitely isn't any language that you know of. You wouldn't even know how to pronounce them. You heard Anrial yell up to you.   
"We can't understand them! Probably some magic language!"   
> Grow a mushroom vine with our fungus magic for our party to climb up   
   
You hold out the fungus gem and think very hard about growing a vine. You look up at the ceiling and see nothing. You cough again which you thought was spores but it was a green thick line coming out of your mouth.   
> Check out the next door   
   
You decide to risk it and look into the next room. When you got near the bed, you hear a strange sword slice noise. The door pounds every time you heard that slink noise.   
> Grab the lantern and try forcing it down the door on the floor to let our party climb up   
   
It didn't work.   
> Tie the pot to the lantern to weight it downwards   
   
You grab the pot and the long lantern. You wrap the lantern around the pot and slowly slide it downwards. It still won't go down but it does curve a little downwards. Maybe it is because the pot isn't heavy enough to counter the force of sideways gravity?   
> Grab the lantern and then jump down with it to allow the party to climb up   
   
You pull the lantern back up and unwrap the pot. This time you will be going down.  You threw the lantern back down where it sway to the walls downstairs. You grab the chainand slowly lower yourself down. You are not going to the walls but instead to the ground where it safely takes you down. Once again, the members are shocked you managed to do this by yourself with the state of mind and body you have. They all immediately begin to climb up the chain while you hold it. Anrial holds you for a moment before going up the chain. They all manage to get up before you climb up there. Lucky that the chain was sturdy enough to hold you. You are all now at the upstairs room.   
> Open the door VIOLENTLY   
   
You jump on the bed to get near the door. You get close to the door and feel it pound against the hinges. It gets hit so hard that it is crazy that the door doesn't fall out like that. You get into position and place your leg near the doorknob. You reel back then kick it open. You are immediately stabbed by a large spike into your stomach. You cry out from the sharp pain and immediately recoil. You fall back to the bed and hold your stomach. The spike continues to extend until it hits next to where the lantern is positioned.   
> Attempt to use fungus crystal to create a vine to the lever and pull it   
   
You sit up on the bed and watch the pole retract and hit the wall. You watch the blood soak your new bandage on your belly. You try to make that vine appear again by holding out that gem and thinking harder this time about the vine to the lever. All that happens is that vine coming out of your mouth gets slightly longer.

> Welp, better call Saul!   
   
You tell Saul that we should sue this place. He stares at you confused on what you meant   
> Ask Anrial to shoot the lever   
   
You look at Anrial and ask her to use her arrows to hit that switch. Isik chuckles and tells her to go for it. She takes out her bow and aims it at the lever. She waits for the spear to go back into the room before trying to shoot the lever. She shoots... a spear from the ceiling stops it. She shoots again, it missed and hit the wall. She shoots again, she hits under the lever. She shoots again, she hit the lever but it doesn't come down. She continues to shoot at it until it snaps from the constant bombardment of arrows and it turns off the machine.   
> Practice using the gem   
   
You hold out the gem once more... You think about creating a mushroom. You imagined a fungus growing in your mind. You felt something on your arm sting. You look and see a large mushroom growing from your arm.   
> Try to make a vine appear once again   
   
You are getting frustrated at not getting the results you want so you try to think about a vine once more. You imagined a vine dangling off the doorway in front of you. You hear a scream. You look back and see Saul holding out his hand to show a vine growing off it. He immediately cuts it off and rubs his arm where it was.    
> Head to the next room   
   
You all watch your steps as you enter the next room. Scared at what you will find this time you listened closely. You can hear mumbling through the room.   
> Open the door tactically   
   
You all tread carefully to the door. The spikes don't go up again but you are still careful. Because the door is on the floor, you have to crouch to open it. But you don't want to open it and check, you want to head right in. You tell your team to get ready to pour in. Isik and Anrial share doubt but the twins are happy with this notion. You stand on the door, squat then jump as high as you can, smashing the door as you drop through.   
You fall with a good landing with the rest of the team jumping in besides Isik who just watches from above. What you find here is... a study room and someone who is in a bathrobe. He is a very old man who looks like you could make him fall by breathing on him but he holds out his hand with something in it like he could kill you if he wanted to. The old man yells out at you and the party holds out their weapons.   
"STOP RIGHT THERE OR YOU WILL BE TURNED TO ASH!"   
> Play dumb   
   
You decided to play dumb and say that you didn't know someone lived here.   
"Oh yeah! I'm sure you going through my things on the way here means no one lives here. What the do you think the traps are for? Animals?!"   
He shifts around the place and looks something behind him.   
> Say that the tower looked abandoned   
   
You tell that man that it looked abandoned how the tower looked fallen and that no man could live in a place like this. The old man stutters.   
"W-well there could have been homeless people living here even if it looks abandoned- what do you want with this place anyways? Are you from Nodok?"   
> Take out the King's scroll   
   
You take out your scroll slowly. The old man stares at your hand and grips whatever is in his hand so tight, his hand turns white. You unscroll the paper and show it to him. Immediately, the old man is angry.   
"I WILL NOT BE ARRESTED BY NODOK! THIS IS MY LAND! NOT YOURS! THIS IS MY MAGIC! YOU WILL DIE!"   
The party looks at you for guidance.   
> Say we're not here to arrest him   
   
You felt your body heating up. You patted your arm as a fire bursts onto your mushrooms. You quickly spoke to the mage that you aren't here to arrest him. You look to the party and they are panicking as well as Anrial's hair is on fire. You quickly took out the flames and told him that you are travelers from Nodok, not soldiers. He continues to glare at you but soon your body felt cooler. "Who are you then!? Speak! I did not wish to be disturbed and you are here breaking down my things!"   
> Convince: "we are just travleres, looking to unfungus ourselves?"   
   
"You... you are human? I thought they decided to enlist a monster to get me. I apologize for my rude behavior. Nodok wishes to imprison me for practicing magic. Yes, I can help you with fixing your body."   
You show the gem to the old mage. You thought he would have laughed like the gang in Nodok did when they gave it to you but instead he looked serious. He places something in his pockets and holds out his hand.   
> Give the gem   
   
You felt a piece of your soul leave when you gave the gem to the mage. He takes it forcibly then leaves to the back of the room on a desk with a book open.   
You felt minutes go by with him reading the book, taking out books, putting books back in.   
"What gem is this?"   
> Tell him the truth   
   
You told him it was a fungus gem you tried to use. He nods his head like he heard this before and went back to reading. He asks more questions and you answer them truthfully. He spins around.   
"How did this happen to you? Did you do this to yourself on purpose because this doesn't just happen on accident."   
> Truth | We did it ourselves   
   
"But you asked to change back to human now."  
You saw the mage's hand enter his pocket again but it stayed there. You felt tension rise in the air like... like a lick of flame.  
> Lie | I mixed up my words  
  
"I see..." You notice that his hand stayed in his pocket. "Well... there is a way to change back to human. But you will have to trust me on this..." You looked back at your party and still notice them with readied weapons, afraid of what will happen...*  
> Trust him  
  
"Now... I want you to sit down on that chair there."  
He points to a "dentist" chair that you lay down in. "If you really want to become human, you will need to trust me"

> Take the gems and ask questions

You ask about the runes in the books.   
"Urg... yeah it's my language. All of the freaking stupid mages got them so idiots likes you couldn't read them."

"Why should I believe you? You are thieves... scavengers. Taking everything that belongs to other people. I just live here by myself and here you are doing... this! I didn't even attack you!"  
> "YOU WERE GOING TO STRAP US TO THIS FUTURISTIC LOOKING CHAIR. SORRY IF WE GOT A LITTLE BIT JUMPY, THAT WAS SKETCH AS HELL AND THE PERSONALITY TJAT IS TALKING TO YOU RIGHT NOW HAD A MILD PHOBIA OF MEDICS"  
  
"YEAH WELL I WANTED TO HELP YOU AND IT ISN'T MY FAULT YOU DON'T LIKE DOCTORS!"  
> Keep asking about the chair  
  
"It's just a chair... You sit in it and I put straps on you so you don't go CRAZY LIKE YOU DID!"  
> Reject the consequences. Go back in time to spare him  
  
**You felt something shift in your mind. You felt like this is deja vu.**  
"Now... I want you to sit down on that chair there."  
He points to a chair that you lay down in  
> Sit in the chair  
  
For some reason, you walked to the chair a lot more energetic than you would have done otherwise.  
The party looks at your weirdly but kept their weapons trained on the mage.  
You looked at the chair, it is just a regular chair that you lay down in. For some reason, you felt weird about this chair but you sat in it anyways then laid down. Isik looks astonished from above seeing you just let yourself trust this man. The old man takes his hand from his pocket and grabs some strips of leather.  
The old man tries your arms and legs down. You felt it to be comfortable weirdly enough but maybe that is because you know something. The old man leaves to a cabinet nearby and takes out a few needles. One of them was glowing yellow. He shoots the liquid into a vial. where he pours other liquid then puts them all into another needle. He comes over with the needle and moves your head to show your neck. He injects the needle into your neck.  
"This... this might hurt a little bit."  
Your neck feels hot and itchy. Then it starts to ache. Then your belly starts to ache. Are you shaking? Who was screaming? That sounded like you. The party runs over to you with Isik jumping down, pushing the mage out of the way.  
Then... it stops  
You felt happy for a moment. You saw a light in the sky. But it grew farther away. You are back to the real world and looked at your arms which is now untied. It looks... normal  
The party looks at you with sad faces and confusion. They explain that they thought he killed you.  
What do you say to them?  
*Fungus Morph deactivated*  
> *the players talk to each other*  
  
Horace looks at Anrial with tears on her face and says...  
"Fungus. My spirit animal is hearthian(outer wilds). I'm not the only thing in here and that we're alright."  
She smiles confusingly but hugs you hard enough to knock the wind from you  
You look where Isik is and you see him pointing his sword at the mage doctor or whoever this guy is.  
> Tell Isik to stand down  
  
You told Isik to stop holding the mage hostage. He notices you alive.  
"So he was right? I thought he killed you. What do we do with this guy? I don't like him, he said he could kill me."  
> We tell isik we're fine and politely ask mage man for o u r  gem back   
  
Isik turns to Horace then back at the mage. You stand up and do some stretching to exaggerate how fine we are. Isik takes the hint and drops his sword to his side. The mage thanks you but has some news.  
"I'm sorry to say this but I don't think you should carry this gem. It's too dangerous for a mere man like you. Look what happened. You said you accidently became that monster!"  
> Ask the gem back  
  
You really want that gem back. You ask for it kindly that you want it. You said you were fine being that 'monster'. You can control it. The old man shakes his head.  
"That... I don't believe you but..."  
He sighs and takes out the dark green gem.  
"It is yours."  
He hands the gem to Isik who then gives it to you.  
> Thank him for helping us  
  
Horace looks at the party who still feels tense about what happened. You thank the man for helping you. He turns to you and speaks.  
"You know, I used to help a lot of people at Nodok until the banned magic. That's when I left to live on my own, outside of Nodok. It is nice to help people once again."  
> Ask how to control magic  
  
"You... you wish to control it? That is a power too great for you to use. I really wanted to keep that so other may not use it for evil but if you so choose to..."  
> Promise we are a good person  
  
You promised the mage that you are a good person. In fact you were a knight. He tensed when you said you were a knight but you manage to explain that you won't take him to Nodok. You want to use the powers of the gem for good.  
"You need to understand how your gem works and what you can do with it. My gem in particular is fire based."  
He holds out his gem, you felt tense for a moment.  
"I cannot use this magic in the winter. It is simply too cold. Just because I have it doesn't mean I can use it whenever I want."  
"Likewise for your gem, you cannot use the gem wherever you want."  
> "What would the antithesis of fungus be?"  
  
"You will strive in nature, dark, dimsy places that are dank with puddles."  
But in urban areas, you may not find the gem fond of being used there with dirt roads with no nutrients for plants to grow or in the walls of castles.  
Think about the areas fungus can grow in. You can make that happen to your will  
"Yes, even inside of humans. But to really understand magic, you don't control it, you coexist with it. You had perks while being a monster, didn't you know that?"  
"I apologize, not a monster. But you liked it."  
"There must be a balance however. You cannot all be a fungus monster, it will consume you. Such as me with this fire gem, I am flammable by technicality so I can expend some of my energy on fire but if I allow fire to overtake me, I turn into ash. There must be a balance however. Understanding this, you understand how to properly user your magical gem. It helps you, but don't rely on it."  
> "What happens if we let the magic express itself as it will"  
  
"Then you shall suffer if you let the magic win"  
> "So what if I let the gem assert its presence on our form without letting it overtake us"  
  
"Then you shall coexist and have the positives and negatives of each other."  
"I may have turned you back to human but you can feel free to turn back into a monster. I'll be here in case you want to be human again"   
> "What if we got the gem’s dust tattooed onto ourself?"  
  
"Some people embedded the gem right into their very bodies. You should only do that if you are not an amateur and want this to be permanent."  
"It may have unintended side effects. This is not a toy."  
> Do it  
  
"I will not do that. I'm a doctor of the people who looks after health. This is not healthy. You will need to find someone else to do this. I'm sorry but I cannot do this for you."  
> Tell him about the zombies and how many, many people could be endangered if we don’t do this. "If you’re so concerned with health, let me do this for their sake"  
  
Horace tells the doctor about the army you need to fight for Nodok. The party joins in on you despite them having different opinions, they trust you to do this.  
Anrial speaks. "People can die if we aren't strong enough to fight this army."  
The twins speaks. "You saw the scroll, this is from the king."  
Isik speaks. "They will run you down too if we lose."  
The mage contemplates on this. He walks back to his desk and read through some papers. You see him ink down some notes. He looks up to the ceiling and then back down.  
"I'll do it then. Not for you. You will regret this but I understand why you want this."  
> "If I can save a single life, I will have no regrets"  
  
He sighs  
"Sit back down on the chair"  
He walks to the cabinets and talks out a long knife.  
> Ready for the procedure  
  
You sit back down onto the chair. You never knew why you felt so weird about this chair but now it is comforting. The doctor doesn't bother to strap you in. You can see his face looking tired  
"Where do you want it? Im going to insert it into you."  
> Our non-dominant arm, near the shoulder  
  
"Then it will be done."  
...  
You stared at the ceiling as this procedure was being done. He didn't even had to take off your armor, it was so ripped from becoming a fungus creature that he can just operate like this. It did hurt that a large cut was being made about the size of a baby's fist. You wondered how that looked like taken out. You felt something be put in. You taste something weird immediately. You almost felt like aborting the surgery but kept on. You thought about the cut there and how there will be mushrooms there when it was finished when all of a sudden.  
"Hey! Be careful what you think about. At least I don't need to close it anymore."  
You didn't know what he meant but you looked at your arm and saw it was covered in fungus already where your cut was. That was quick.  
> Ask the mage how to get out  
  
The old man stretches his back and admires his handiwork on your arm.  
"Oh yes of course"  
He points to a hatch near the desk  
The party walks to the hatch with Saul opening it. It looks like it just leads to the outside.  
You know, if you checked your surroundings before you went in, you might have seen this hatch  
But it's fine now, you all open the hatch and walk outside  
You are standing at the **Fire Mage's Tower**.  
> Steal the axe!  
  
Your eyes shine at the axe and wondered if you could use it. You tried yanking it out but it wouldn't budge. It is stuck to the doorframe. You followed the chain where it is connected to the ceiling. It just seems to be a chain that goes into a hole in the ceiling  
How do you take this axe?   
> Go inside and close the door  
  
You told the party to stay outside while you go inside to figure it out. You try closing the door but the axe is blocking the door from closing  
> Carve around the axe with our sword  
  
You took out your Long Sword and got to work to carving the axe out from the doorframe. It takes a while, so long in fact that the party is wondering what you are doing in there until it falls to the ground. The axe is loose... With a piece of the doorframe still attached to the sharp end of the axe  
> Close the door now  
  
You try closing to door to see if it triggers anything. You waited for a moment but that doesn't do anything so you just open it again when you hear a clicking sound coming from the hole in the ceiling where the chain is going through  
> Hack the chain with the sword  
  
Growing frustrated at the axe not letting up and tired of puzzles, you decide to brute force it and try cutting the chain with your long sword. You tried hacking through the chain which created sparks.   
Then you tried cutting through it. Your sword isn't the best for slicing through metals but this is the best you can do. You take too long to the point your party comes in and checks on what you are doing. Isik laughs at you considering this to be your dumbest idea yet while Anrial tries helping you by taking turns cutting the chain.  
It takes you a while but you got the chain axe  
Obtained Chain Axe  
ATK ?  
P ?  
- Massive Failure possibility  
  
Your Long Sword is broken.  
> Switch to the Chain Axe as your main weapon while planning to fix your Long Sword  
  
You carry the axe on to your back and wrap the chain around your body. You think you look really cool and intimidating with a huge axe made for a trap is on your back.  
> Follow the road towards Pomm  
  
It is currently nighttime.  
> Go down the path and tent in the forest  
  
You decide to camp in the forest where you are more secluded. You gather your party and make your way towards Pomm where you will definitely find more buildings on the way there and towns outside of kingdoms. The forest bears down on you. You feel like there are things watching you. You find an old remains of a campfire you can use. You decide to camp here. While you were settings things up you felts something is staring at you. You take a quick look around and see everyone taking out cloth bags to sleep in and firewood.  
> Look around the woods then help  
  
You don't look around that thoroughly as you were more focused to help your teammates. You couldn't find the thing that was bothering you so you decide to finish up then sleep.  
You were in the middle of a dream when you wake up to hear the sounds of screaming. You don't remember taking your new weapon out but what you saw scared you.  
Wolf pulls Anrial away into the wood.  
There are 2 Wolves standing between you and the woods  
The twins attack separately   
Isik attacks the Wolf  
**Anrial is missing**  
You are in the middle of preparing to attack

Wolf pulls Saul away into the wood.  
There are 0 Wolves standing between you and the woods  
The Paul attacks the left wolf  
**Saul is missing**  
Isik guards against the left wolf  
**Anrial is missing**  
Horace attacks the left wolf  
Left Wolf has fallen   
> Follow Anrial's wolf  
  
You quickly pull your axe back from the carcass of the fallen wolf and follow where you think Anrial was pulled to. Isik follows along however Paul goes towards Sual. You continue running and find a Wolf biting her neck and shaking her around.  
> Attack with chain  
  
You pull back on the chain and whip it towards the Wolf. The chain splatters Wolf blood across Anrial. The Wolf lets go of Anrial and runs away  
> Help Anrial  
  
You sat down and helped out Anrial by tying a cloth around her neck but gently so it wouldn't choke her. Isik however ran after the wolf to pressumably kill it.  
"It-It almost killed me! These are feral animals out here!"  
You nod your head at Anrial and help her follow you to camp where you find the twins shaken up. You stare at the cut open Wolf that you killed. You all waited at the camp in silence when Isik shows up with a wolf carcass and sets it down  
You find the twins there at the camp already.  
> Check if wolf meat is safe  
  
Isik nods his head and says there shouldn't be anything wrong with the meat but he would need to cut it open to make sure  
Isik takes out his short sword and slices the carcass open. You can see his hands move the skins off and checks the belly and the meat. He is careful with it though to not let the ground touch the meat. He nods his head again to signify it is safe to eat.  
> Eat wolf  
  
Isik cuts off pieces of the wolf while Paul grabs a long stick and washes it of dirt. Isik takes the stick from Pual and pushes the meat into the sick and hovers it over the fire. You try to help Isik by holding the other end but he just leaves you with the meat stick and sits next to the twins. Reluctantly, you twist the stick to cook the meat. You look at Anrial is is curled in her cloth sleeping bag staring at the meat.  
After it is finished, you cut it inside smaller pieces with the dagger from one of the twins and have a good feast that is better than the rations you usually eat. In fact, you are satisified by the food.  
Health: 15/25 + 5  
You slept peacefully without any other events happening in the night.  
Health 20/25 + 2  
You wake up to see the party speaking to each other.   
> Let the party know what we're doing and we'll be back though  
  
Isik pipes up  
"You want to go to the town by yourself? Well we want to go too."  
> Say they can come  
  
Everybody packs up their things and got ready to follow you. The only thing left is that same campfire you found before. You follow down the path through the forest. The trees bear down on you like they are staring down. Luckily the forest doesn't go on forever and you find a cabin. You might be close to the town.  
> Knock on the door  
  
You knock on the door. Nobody answers.  
> Open it  
  
You open the door. You see a lot of pots, hampers, and crates. This looks like storage room.  
> Walk into town  
  
Not wanting to resort to stealing right now, you close the door with the twins watch you. They look disappointed when you came out empty handed. Nevertheless, you continued down the path where the houses grew more plentiful then stores then you see a tavern. This is not a big town by any means but it looks to be a nice place to live in. You have enters Gillerd  
> Use the enters Gillerd  
  
You distort reality for just a moment then it disappears  
On your way to Pomm, you come across the town of Gillerd. What do you wish to do?  
> Go to a blacksmith  
  
You look around for a blacksmithing building but you have a hard time finding one. The party follows you around but it is hard to properly find a smithing area when you stop every few seconds because the part is looking at something else. Since this is a new town you found, Anrial suggests we split up and meet back at this spot when it gets near night.  
> Split  
  
You were growing tired of constantly trying to get them together while they desperately wanted to look around by themselves so you told them they could leave as long as they come back. Isik immediately walks away while the twins stick by you. Anrial walks out as well looking for whatever she wanted to look at. It appears the twins don't really know where to go so they stay with you but luckily they don't stop every five seconds. With a pace like this, you find a blacksmith or someone that looks like a blacksmith chewing something outside of a building. He looks dead at you then spits something on the floor.  
"Ye? What you want?"  
> Ask for weapon and clothing stats  
  
"Eh? You want to see what you things are capable of? Yeah hehe... that's cost ya some money. 2G and you see what they got"  
> Pay  
  
He looks surprised when you hand him two gold.  
"Oh wow, people usually run off when they hear they need to pay cause they are cheap and try to scrounge up every copper they see. Oh alright, come inside."  
He points to the door next to him which seems to be a back exit. You go in ready to get your money's worth.  
You see a giant furnace with logs and a superheated item inside. You also see an anvil that every blacksmith has. Tools decorate the walls with a giant pot of water nearby.  
You give him your weapons and looks at your clothings.  
"You know, I could have told you without paying that your armor is useless. What did you do to it? You looked like you did this on purpose."  
He also looks at the twins who are currently in your party.   
"Now these can save some lives if you don't care about them."  
+5 health | +2 Defense for both Paul and Saul  
He stares at the weapons you have and holds them up to a lantern. You puts it on the anvil and cleans off the blood on them. He doesnt seem to care that there is blood on them.  
"This here axe you got is unusual but whatever you want. The daggers your kids have are useable but don't expect anything from them.  
Horace - Chain axe - 8 ATK | 10 P   
5% MASSIVE FAILURE  
Paul - Dagger - 3 ATK   
Saul - Double Daggers - 7 ATK  
  
"Did you get what you wanted? Yes? No? Good, get out."  
"I was on my break"  
You were booted out of the blacksmith and back into the town of Gillerd.  
> Ask for quests at the townhall  
  
You left the area to find a townhall of sorts. You walk around and checked where there is a huge spike in people or official looking people. You did find someone with a nice cloth suit. You had to ask him where the town hall was and he is nice enough to show you where. You walked to where he said and sure enough you found it. You entered right in up the stairs and saw a large meeting room full of people but they all seem to be talking casually and in regular clothings. You continued walking through and found a woman in a dress writing something on a desk facing towards you.  
"Yes? I understand there is someone stealing things, we already know. We are working on it."  
> Ask about the quest  
  
"Oh, I suppose this is a quest. There is a serial criminal taking valuable items from homes no matter what time of day it is. He or she wears cloth around their face so we can't see and they are fast."  
"Is there anything else you want to know?"  
> "What time are they most active"  
  
She sighs and speaks "What do you think? I just said at no matter the time it is. They usually do it when people are working."  
> Look for the culprit  
  
How do you look for them?  
> Ask recent victims  
  
You went out of town hall and overheard the people sitting in the table talking about the issue of getting robbed. You think this would be a good start. You go up to a man wearing tattered clothings. He is speaking to another man with equal clothings.  
"... trying to get home and then when I got home, I couldn't find my compass or my exotic clothes. I had to come here wearing this! This makes me sick!"  
The two man notices you.  
"Are you part of the police? We need help but the girl at the table said they are helping even though we been here for days!"  
What do you ask?  
> Leave town hall  
  
You leave the town hall finding the side quest to not be of interest of you while the people you were talking with that expected you to help them just look sad and confused when you leave randomly.  
> Get drunk before doing the side quest  
  
You needed to have a nice ale first before doing anything. You told the twins that we were going to the bar and they yank your hands to the nearest bar that you passed by. It had saloon doors and a broken window on the side. Seems like a fun place. Before you entered the door, a slender man in formal clothings was dropkicked out of the bar and landed onto his face without moving afterwards. You walked over him and found a beautifully colorful place full of beer and bar fights.  
A slight chubby woman and man see you enter the bar.   
"Ooh a new face! Welcome to Gillerd's Brewery. We make em fresh here. What do you want honey?"  
> Mix all drinks together and drink it straight  
  
The chubby man behind the counter looks at you happily. He grabs some things from the bottom cabinet then from the top. He chops some things back there. The woman compliments you.  
"My my! Someone is a hefty man who needs a manly drink. One Devil's Tornado coming up!"  
The man brings it to you in a cup that you need two hands for. You look inside and swear that the liquid had an evil laugh.  
> Drink it all at once  
  
You grab the drink aggressively and pour it down your gullet. It wasn't even liquid you realized as you drank it. It was more of a soup with chunks that you had to chew through. You felt the ingredients mix together like how oil and water mixes. You didn't bother to really taste how it looked but you did feel it all slushily go down. You put the drink down on the bar table with a resounding bang. You realized the room was quiet. You look around and see everyone is staring at you. There is even someone mid fight looking at you while they are getting punched. Then everybody cheers for you.  
> Pay or get another drink?  
  
You didn't feel so good. Your thoughts were somehow more disorganized than usual. In fact you can hear your thoughts fighting each other on whether to get another drink  
> ONE MORE  
  
You burp and stutter for another drink. The bartenders look very concerned.  
"Honey, this is a feat for itself! You don't have to prove yourself to anyone."  
You say nonsense and ask for another.  
"Devil's Tornado coming up"  
The bar is quiet again. There is a man hanging from his legs on the ceiling waiting for the drink to be made. The drink is once again created and poured into the same cup and placed it down. Your hand shakes, your mouth is on fire, you can't think but you need to make the voices happy. It makes you happy. You aren't so thirsty anymore or hungry. You chew on bits of eggs shells and tough bone while the beer and hot sauce fight each other. You swallow it all. The bar once again cheers for you and some people even hug you. The twins who got only water tell everyone that they know you and are friends. The last thing you remembered is putting a coin on the counter before falling backwards.  
  
You wake up with your trousers stuck on a pole hanging off it.  
> Look around  
  
You look around. You are very high up.  
Where are you  
Man you... you feel sleepy  
  
You don't remember how but you are on the ground.  
Horace laughs as he found it funny that you are suddenly on the ground. You continued to look around. You are.. where the heck are you?   
> Find the twins  
  
You walk around the place to find your... your... who were they again? Are they friends? Or family or...  
This house looks familiar. You continued to walk around looking for your sons. This house looks familiar. Do you think maybe Isik has them? He is so mean. Why is he with you? This house looks familiar. Have you been past here before?  
Maybe they left to that... um...  
Where are you going again?  
Of course. The last place they been in  
The um  
> Go to the bar  
  
Oh now you remember where you wanted to go. You needed to get a um... a drink. You are so thirsty. And hungry too. And... you wanted to go there for some reason  
Everything went dark  
Oh you are sleeping on the table. You are in the middle of eating. Yeah, you were  
This guy next to you is so annoying  
The food is the best thing you ever had  
He keeps talking about how um... you were doing stuff.  
> Fight  
  
You get up and see the man back away. You don't remember how but the guy is on the floor mumbling about his broken nose. Oh my God that is loud. Why is everyone so loud? They are screaming at you and the nice bartenders have knives at you.  
The mushroom around your fingers make it hard to enjoy your food. The chair breaks by your weight  
  
A group of 12 civilians stand in your way

Health 20/25 - 14  
> Flee  
  
You were knocked senselessly enough to get your sense back. You finally realized what was happening. You ran out of the bar and into the middle of the streets where you see everyone screaming.   
> Run into forest through the crowd  
  
You try running back where you came from into the forest. You had to tackle through the crowd to get to the forest where they manage to hit you a few times.   
Health: 6/25 - 2  
You make it make it back to the forest where you came from. You didn't bother going down the pathway but instead deep into the forest in unmarked territory  
In your panicked drunken state of mind, you find it hard to reorientate  yourself. You might be lost  
> Eat the moss. Perpetuate the cycle of existence  
  
You perpetuated the cycle of existence. You ate the moss. It tasted mossy. You HP was mossed out.  
> Follow the blue light  
  
You swear you saw a blue light but only for a second. It must've just flashed but you went to go follow it again. Going between the tree, you realized the severity of your wounds. You are feeling faint. You want to rest but you need to be somewhere safe.  
> Follow the light  
  
You can't stop now. You need to press on. You can't... you need to... You lay on a tree. You must've been walking for miles. It sure felt like it. You laid you head on a tree when you saw it. You smiled. Through the openings of the tree you saw it. That fallen tower in the distance. You walked to the tower and went up to the door.  
> Knock  
  
Bleeding and out of your wits, you turn to someone that can help you. Every pound on the door hurts your arm especially where the gem is. After knocking a few times, you heard several clicks and the door opening. The old man appears in front of your face.  
"No I don't- Oh welcome- what happened to you?"  
> Ask to sleep  
  
The mage helps you go towards the back of the tower to the hatch where you find a familiar room. That surgery chair with his study desk.  
"I apolgize but I do not have a proper guest room. Of couse not that you would be able to sleep on my bed, it is currently upsidedown."  
The mage helps you get onto the chair. It feels like the most comforting thing in the world.  
"What happened to you? Do you need help turning back into human? Where are you friends?"  
"Are you okay?"  
> "no"  
  
"Tell me what happened"  
> "Whatever you do *hrrrk*, DO **NOT** get the Devil’s Tornado"  
  
"What is wrong with you? Even the people at Nodok knows not to get the Devil's Tornado. But uh... it usually makes people sick, not loose blood."   
> "HOW WERE WE SUPPOSED TO KNOW"  
  
"Well have you see the people at Gillerd. I don't even go there for food, I go there for entertainment."  
> "The food was really good, actually"  
  
The mage sits next to you and takes out the same vials and bottles from a nearby cabinet.  
"Uh huh... tell me about the food. By the way, do you need help with the fungus monster thing?"  
> "no"  
  
"You sure? We went through that trouble last time and you are fine with it now?"  
> "We figured out how to control it"  
  
"Is that so? I would like to see it happen"  
You held out the gem and thought about the mushrooms. You thought about it regressing back into your body. It is apart of you now but you do not wish for it to be visible right now. You felt it sting all over your body. Your entire body hurts as your flesh shifts around, imploding on itself. Then.. you are back to human.  
You look at your body and see it looks pretty bad. All of those cuts and new bruises makes your skin look black and blue. Despite all of this, you smile at the mage who looks impressed.  
"A day ago you couldn't do this and now you can. That is pretty well of you. But unfortunately I am not sure if you can make it with this level of violence on your body."  
> Ask for heal  
  
"You wish for me to heal your wounds? I can do that but it may hurt."  
The man levitates upstairs. You hear some grunting. It takes several seconds but he comes down stairs with a metal spear. It appears to be superheated.  
"I do not have healing magic but I got this. Alright, stand still the best you can"  
> Trust  
  
You felt your heart drop when you saw the superheated spear but you have no other option. You will be a dead man otherwise.  
The Fire Mage slowly inches closer to close our bleeding wounds with his hands and light presses the heated spear on it, cauterizing the wound instantly. It feels painful but you have to do this.  
Health 4/20 + 8  
You just remember yelling but afterwards, you think you felt better and a lot of pain. He smiles at you with his head tilted in concern. He notices your strange face.  
"You okay?"  
> Thank him  
  
You thank the Fire Mage  
"My pleasure, not the pain I meant but the uh healing."  
> Leave the tower  
  
You decide to leave the tower. You need to find your party even if it night time. You thank the mage again before leaving. The hatch opens and your wounds ache. You look up at the sky and asee the night sky. You are tired but you press on down the path.  
Gillerd is not a close place so you have to be careful around these woods. As you were thinking this, you heard a howl. Not again.  
> Ready our weapons but sneak through  
  
You decide to do both sneak and ready your weapons. Being on edge like this makes you go in a remarkable slow pace.  
You twist your head at every noise, scared what it may be when you heard a stick snap and some rustling right behind a dark shadow of a tree.  
> Sneak  
  
You focus on the noise and decide to sneak not past it but towards it. Whatever it may be, you need to see what it is. What you find... is a deer eating the side of a snake. It looks at you, startled and runs away. Disgusted at what you saw, you look at the snake. The midsection is completely missing, the sneak is in two parts, ew.  
> GROW FUNGI ON THE SNAKE. LET ITS MATTER ACHIEVE A GREATER FORM. WE ARE MAKING THE SNAKE ASCEND. ITS DECAYING CELLS SHALL BE CONVERTED INTO MYCELIUM.  
  
You think about the snake and felt the gem on your arm. You thought about it decomposing and fungus growing on it. You looked at the snake and saw a small mushroom growing where the crime scene has taken place.  
> make it consume the snake  
  
You continued to think about the mushrooms consuming the snake. More fungi pops up, sprouting from the snake itself and it.  
> MORE  
  
The fungi continues to spread until the snake isn't visible anymore, roots like tendrils spread all over the snake, gripping it like a hand. They snake will soon decompose and the fungi will feed on it.  
> Now let it consume all in our wake  
  
You left the mushroom continue it's work by itself. You even lightly touched it where a small root wrapped around your finger. You let it be  
It soon connects to the other fungi in the wild as it socializes with the world  
Independent now but it will soon turn to the collective as it should  
> Find that deer  
  
You don't really know where that deer went but you have a feeling to go somewhere. You ran towards where you think it went, cutting through trees. What you find in your wake are other dead animals that includes more snakes, wolves, squirrels, and even deer.  
> Find that deer!  
  
You continued to follow that deer. More corpses follow its wake of destruction. You get the feeling that this is a bad idea.  
You get closer to where you think that deer is. Unfortunately, you will need to focus in other to do what you want with you gem, wasting time. You are deep in the forest where the trees are bearing down on you. You can't find that deer but what you hear is... squealing?  
You followed that noise and saw that deer holding down a wolf. It's mouth is around its neck and squeezing its jaw down. Blood is squirting from the neck while the deer continues to chew on it. The wolf stops moving and the deer gets to work on the sides of the wolf.  
> Sneak attack  
  
You sneak past the small sticks and leaves on the ground. You manage to past them gracefully. You get closer to the deer and you pull out your Chain Axe as silently as you can. You wind it up then throw it to the deer. The Chain Axe slices the back of the deer and it is immediately enraged.  
  
The Deer(?) stands on its legs

> Yell for help  
  
**Anrial is missing**  
**Isik is missing**  
**The Twins are missing**  
The Deer(?) twirls the axe and throws it towards you. It slices your arm. You get the feeling you are on your last legs  
You tried yelling for help. You heard yelling back. You need to wait for a turn.  
The Deer(?) twirls the axe  
Your health is 2/20   
  
You wake up with a light shining down on you. You felt like death. You look around and see a familiar face.   
"Morning. I heard you yelling."  
It's the Fire Mage. "Shush. You'll bring it back. I had to scare the beast off with fire..."  
"You took some damage... Don't get up"  
You look around and tried to get up but realize you couldn't. You feel to your side when you tried to get up. Confused, you look at your arm...  
*Your left arm is missing.*  
"I did what I could but... It chewed your arm right off. I know I am always the one to help you but this thing I cannot fix."  
*Danger: You lost max health! Health: 1/15*  
(mushroom's name set to Patrice Terry)  
"I'm sorry to say but you are in no shape to fight. You... You have to abandon your mission. Yeah that mission from your scroll? Go back to Nodok. Someone more suitable will take your place. I'm... I'm sure the King will be happy to see you alive though."  
> Talk with the Fire Mage, ask his name  
  
"I'm sorry, I cannot tell you that in case Nodok guards tries to link my family through my name. It has happened before and I had to... silence them. You understand?"  
> "Do you know any good prosthetic places?"  
  
"There is a place far on your travels. You have to continue your way there for something that can bring your arm back. But I would not risk it. It's too dangerous. You are better off leaving."  
"The best I can do it a long stick as your arm. I'm not a good doctor for flesh, just for magic. I just know where basic parts are. More likely you will find doctors in Nodok or Gillerd but I doubt they will do much."  
> Give one (1) fungus to the mage to thank him  
  
You hand a small mushroom to the mage as thanks. The mage takes it with confusion.  
"You are a strange man."  
> Use fungi magic to implant broken sword as our left arm  
  
You held the sword up to your shoulder and tried to summon fungi to hold it in place. You though about the fungi growing around the handle. The fungi does grow and hold the handle but you cannot move it.  
"I admire the commitment to your magical abilities but I am afraid this is something you cannot fix unless you are very creative."  
> Ask the mage for info about using the flesh and bones from the skinwalker's victims and using magic to hold it together  
  
He looks at you disgusted but answers your question  
"Ugh... wouldn't... wouldn't the mushrooms constantly eat the rotting flesh if it connected to it? The only reason the fungus doesn't eat you is because the food you eat is what the fungus also eats. If you will use dead meat as an arm... you will need to always fix it. I did say you would need to be creative and... this is creative I suppose."  
You look excited at getting your arm back even if it isn't really an arm. The mage shakes his head.  
"I will go with you. You sure are a strange man. Are you right in the head?"  
> Allow the mage to follow us  
  
You allowed the mage to follow you along. You look to be at the exact same place where you fought the deer. Blood from the battle is splattered everywhere. You traced your steps to where you saw the carcasses and see that they are rotting already. Mushrooms are already eating the corpses, making it harder for the meat to stick to each other. Nevertheless, you remove your sword from your arm and squish meat onto your stubbed arm. You thought about the fungi roots holding it in place, keeping it stable. Roots grow through your shoulder and into the rotting meat. Mushrooms grow at that meat, covering it like a scale skin. You look ecstatic while the mage looks disgusted. You continued getting globs of meat and place it longer and longer on your body, sticking bones through the meat to act like your bones and to keep it from being a wobbly long string of meet. The best thing you can use for a hand is a wolf paw so you slowly pulls that paw away from the rotting corpse and placed it on the end of your rotting wrist. You got a new hand!  
  
You paw falls down while connected to roots like a hinge and inside your wrist was a bone that slowly moved to the side. There is now a large hole leading down your arm that occasionally coughs spores.  
> Create a Bone Axe  
  
The smell of rotting meat bothers you but having one less arm bothers you more. You also need a weapon that isn't a broken sword. You ripped the spine off a snake and grabbed the jaw of wolf. Using tendons as twine, you tied it together for a small chain axe that can't fully rotate but it is what you have.  
Decomposing corpses are your tools like fungi. You realize you are becoming more like fungi every day  
> Yipee?  
  
You look back at the fire mage and see him throwing up  
"Hrrk! I'm sor- HRRK! That's disgusting" He walks further away, while continuing to puke  
The mage comes back after finishing. He looks pretty sick and he won't look at you.  
"I'm sorry but that is nasty. I should keep going with you to keep you safe. You are still hurt but keep this up, I'll leave right away ugh..."  
> Leave with mage in direction of Gillerd  
  
You decide going with a magic based temporary(?) party member is better than using armor if you are already almost dead.  
The mage showed you the way towards the path that you seek so you can walk towards Gillerd. Through the woods, you find a patch of mushrooms that you remembered you summoned to eat the snake. You checked up on it and saw that it was having a nice feast. Happy that it is fine, you continued on your way to finding the path when you heard people calling your name.  
"HORACE! WHERE ARE YOU! WE KNOW YOU RAN THIS WAY!"  
> Follow the voices in the forest  
  
You went deeper into the forest to find those voices. Odd how it is in the middle of the forest.  
You continued to follow the voices with the mage behind you. The mage confused, followed the voices too until you reached the source of it. You see a Deer(?) with a Chain Axe on its back walking around.  
The Deer(?) looks dead at you  
  
The Deer(?) twirls the axe  
Your health is 2/15  
> Run away!!  
  
You realized it was a bad idea to fight this Deer(?) so you immediately run away but before you could, the Fire Mage stepped up to the Deer(?) and drank something from a flask. He grew closer to the Deer(?) who is backing away. The Fire Mage holds out a gem and spits into it causing a large fire breath to shoot out towards the Deer(?). The leaves all around the fire burnt to a crisp. The ground around him catches fire. The fur around the Deer(?) catches fire and it immediately runs away.  
  
"Animals hate fire"  
"We should get back to the path"  
Horace and Mage decide to walk back to the pathway. You found the land mark of carcasses and mushrooms on the way to the path until you found the road. You want to go to Gillerd to stock up and maybe find your friends again. You and the Mage walk down the path while he tries making conversation but you usually do not answer but he keeps trying. You did come across wolves but he blew fire at them too. He seemed to be a great asset at least right now.   
You make it to Gillerd where you find it bustling with people. You tried to keep going but this is where the Mage stops.  
"I cannot go any farther. I rather not talk with these people."  
> Ask nicely to come  
  
Horace asks the Mage to come along  
"They don't like me."  
> Continue to convince the mage to come along  
  
You want the Mage to come along  
"They are scared of my magic. I'm sorry."  
> Leave him  
  
You decide to leave the Mage. You thank him for everything he did then leave him. He waves goodbye. As you entered the town, it looks like a monster went through this area. Some buildings walls are caved in and the ground looks like a hole was dug for each step.  
There are plenty of people repairing the damages of this place when you saw a woman looking at you then run away. You saw several people do this.  
You wanted to ask about what happened to Gillerd while you were gone but everytime you tried, they usually run away  
You continued to persist to find someone but they kept running away. You get the feeling you will find trouble.  
> Convince the people I'm (h)armless  
  
They continued to run away and in fact. Some people wearing some armor appear before you brandishing weapons. The tall slender guard speaks to the other tall chubby guard  
"Is that Horace? Look at his arm? I'm not sure if we should capture him."  
> Tell them (short version) of what happened. and that we mean no harm  
  
You told the guards that you were the one that turned into a monster in the bar and attacked people and you were sorry because you were drunk but before you could finish, they immediately grab you.  
> Continue to convince  
  
Your continued attempts to say you are harmless and you were sorry meant nothing as they gag you with cloth.  
"Man this guy won't shut up."  
You take you around town while people around you cheered seemingly for your arrest.  
  
"They take you near town hall to what seemed to be the jail station of this place. You are taken in and over heard them talking.  
"Yeah this guy is real scum, fighting people, causing a ruckus, destroying the town. We'll take them with the others."  
You are lead down stairs to a small row of jail cells. Some of them are empty while others are not. They continued walking and found a small cell for you. They ungagged you and throw you in. Your rotting left arm almost falls off but luckily it stayed attached.  
You sat in the crappy bad and thought about the things that happened when you were drunk. You done a lot of bad things and more that you don't remember doing. While you were reminiscing, you heard someone call out to you. It was Isik and the Twins.  
"So Horace, what are you in for?"  
> "To be honest wit ya im not quite sure. They say i destroyed the town, but i dunt remember doin that"  
  
"Yeah, you were on a rampage. They ran you out, ran through some housings, I think you punched a pole and almost broke it. Some part of it caught on fire."  
You overheard the Twins complaining while Isik kept talking.  
"I don't know what else you did but I thought you were supposed to be a good guy. How did this happen?"  
> "Fungus."  
  
You wanted to speak back but Isik interrupts you.  
"Whatever, I don't want to hear it"  
"What's the deal smart man? We waiting here for... several months? Won't that army take out this place in the path of destruction?"  
> Try to persuade a guard to get you out  
  
You yell out for a guard to notice you and when they did, you tried to convince them that you were sorry.  
"Yeah well everybody is sorry when they get into jail. I don't want to hear it from a criminal."  
Isik just look bored as the guard passes by but the twins are lightly crying  
> Go fungi  
  
You tried morphing into a fungus creature once more to break through the metal bars. You aren't sure if you will break through these though. You gained mushroom scales all around your body. You felt fully connected throughout your skin. You tried pulling on the bars. It bent but it would break. You grunted as the bars continued to bend but while this is happening, a guard overheard the noise and came rushing to your cell to see what was happening. They brandished a spear. You are on low health so you aren't sure if you could fight him.  
> Stop  
  
The soldier came by fully to see what was going on. You tried fixing the bars so it wouldn't look off. The soldier so you messing with the bars.  
"Hey! Stop making all that noise, it is annoying and will uh, make your sentence longer."  
He walked off. Isik lightly chuckled.  
You sat by your bed again. The only thing of note you see is Isik constantly looking around and pressing on the walls and ceiling. Surely a hardened criminal like him will have some sort of plan if it comes to him  
> "you got a better idea mr criminal?"  
  
"Yeah yeah I'm working on it Mr Knight. And keep your voice down"  
Isik continues to look inside and outside of his jail when he points at something. You look at what he is pointing and you a very tall barred window outside of the jail cell leading back into town  
He then points to something out of your view and lightly slaps the side of his hip a couple of times, makes a twisting motion with his hand, then two fingers moving separately then points to the window. He then points up one index finger after a second then points to the stairs   
He makes a thumbs up  
> I make a thumbs down and whisper (what the hell does any of that mean??)  
  
He slaps his forehead then does that again. He points to you then to his temple and jabs it a couple of times  
  
Isik jabs his index finger to his chest, makes a circle with his thumb and index finger that is on his hip then moves his arm away while he points to something out of view while making a talking gesture with his hand. He then points to you  then shakes the bars gently  
He gives you a wink  
> ok got it he wants us to distract the guard with talking  
  
You give Isik the thumbs up after acting out every movement he does.  
Horace and Isik both ask the guard to come over to them despite being in seperate cells   
"I'm not a servant to criminals but I need to check on you. Don't make this a thing."  
The guard walks over to your cell  
You can see Isik panic while the guard moves to your cell.  
Isik, while the guard is looking away, points at you and points at the guards waist which has a key decides to shake the bars and make a scene  
"I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE IM INNOCENT"  
> Take the key  
  
Horace takes the moment to grab the key off the latch on the guards pocket.  
You grab the key but you aren't no sneak. The guard felt something and immediately looks at you confused.  
> Hide the key in our fungal flesh and play dumb  
  
You pressed the key into the rotting flesh that is your left arm in hopes of hiding it. You ask the guard why is he looking at you while Isik is right about to escape. The guard thinks you are right and leaves out of view?  
He comes back with a double pronged spear and is walking to Isik's cell   
> Use the Henry Stickmin teleporter  
  
~~You teleport into the abyss~~  
## ~~Fail~~  
*~~Why do you even try~~*  
~~Map~~  
~~Restart~~  
> Shake the bars  
  
You shake the bars of your prison, hoping to make a racket so that the guards focus will be on you. Unfortunately you are not the priority and the guard stabs Isik in the shoulder then went to look at you.  
"Oh yeah? You want to escape too?"  
He walks over in a stride  
> Show the guard the Royal Scroll  
  
You check your pockets and under your armor for the scroll but it seemed to be missing?  
You looked for your broken sword too and that is also missing  
They must've taken them while carrying you to jail  
You hear Isik cursing in the back while the twins are trying to tend to his wounds  
> Use magic  
  
You feel your gem tattoo on your shoulder and think about something... The guard is on your cell  
> SPORE BLAST HIS EYES  
  
Your hand paw unhinged from its wrist, falling right off showing a large hole going down your forearm that is full of mushrooms holding it open. The guard looks disgusted, stops immediately like he hit an invisible wall.  
You shoot spores onto his face, mainly his eyes. His face is covered in yellow and green spores that look like booger chunks. His screaming is loud and you take the time to unlock the cell you are in. You are finally outside of that cramp cell. You hear pounds coming downstairs   
> Knock out and then open Isik's door  
  
You manifest vines that comes out of the guard's arms. You take the opportunity to wrap his arms around using the vines. He struggles aggressively while you try to tie him up but you think you have it. You tried to unlock the door with Isik inside when two guards enter the scene.  
> Open the door anyway  
  
You take the time to open Isik's cell but that gives the time for the guards to attack you one of the spears hit your rotting arm while then other hit your leg. You fall to the ground while opening the door causing the twins and Isik to ascend upon them.  
> Run through  
  
You try push past the guards but they stop you. You are kneeling on the ground trying to get back up when Isik sucker punches one causing them to momentarily black out and fall to the ground while Saul jumps on top of the guard, hammering him down. Paul is helping you up go upstairs.   
> Spore blast them on the way  
  
You shot spores around the place, covering the area with yellow substance. Unfortunately, you cannot aim well in this state and cover Saul. The force of the spores being shot out pushes Isik away from you along with the two guards. The guard that Saul is attacking falls on top of him. Paul continues to help you upstairs.  
"They can handle it, I'll help them out. Look for Anrial!"  
You continue upstairs into the lobby. You leave the jail place and think about where to find Anrial.  
> Go to that area they told you to meet up when you split up  
  
You walked to the place where you think you remembered you told them to get to. It was near the entrance of the town. You continued to walk there but grow antsy when you don't see anyone there but despite that, you continued walking there. You look around but see no one you recognize.   
> Ask around  
  
You tried talking to the citizens but they move away from you. In fact, some of them run away from you. You get the feeling of deja vu  
> Go to bar  
  
You couldn't find anyone around that liked you so you decide to go to your now favorite place, the bar. You heard whispers around the vicinity while people nearby ran away. You should leave this town soon. You found that same bar with a sign that says "WE DON'T SELL DEVIL'S TORNADO ANYMORE!" That might be your fault. You continued inside where everybody stops talking and looks dead at you. You looked around and saw Anrial sitting in a table alone, eating.   
> Talk with Anrial  
  
You continued inside the bar. You see some people get up and leave however. You didn't any mind. You walked over to Anrial. She started talking without looking at you.  
"I told you... I don't know where he is."  
She looks up. Her eye is bruised and she had been crying. She looks surprised to see you. She practically jumps over the table to hug you. You don't think she even notices your rotting arm.  
> Ask what happened  
  
You looked at your face and held it up with your rotting arm. Horace asked what happened.  
"They- they didn't like me after I said I was looking for you. I told them I knew you and they all got mad at me. I had to run away. I get regularly interviewed to track you down and what you are. They thought you were a monster but you aren't that. They don't know that but you done bad things and I know that."  
> Order some food  
  
You went up to the bar to ask for some food. When the bartendes saw you, they picked up knives. The once friendly woman helping you get drinks is now angry at you.  
"YOU! GET OUT OR I'LL DO IT MYSELF"  
> Leave the bar  
  
Realized you may have overstayed your welcome, you decide to take Anrial and leave. You hold her wrist and take her to the bar when two guards show up. One of them looks tired and bruised with a busted lip.  
"That's Horace! Get him!"  
The hurt guard wobbles along  
> Go through a separate door  
  
You look around the place for another exist and see a door leading to the back of the building near the bartenders however they stand in your way. The guards now closer cut off your exist routes.  
> Go through bartenders  
  
The Bartenders (Civilians) are holding two knives pointed at you.  
Your health is 8/15  
*Warning: missing weapons*  
> Run away  
  
Anrial fled the scene   
**Isik is missing**  
**The Twins are missing**  
The Bartenders throw knives at you as a last ditch effort. Only one of them hit  
You fled the scene  
Health: 5/15  
  
You find yourself in what appears to be a storage place in the bar. You keep going, finding another door and there you find that you are outside finally. You see guards moving into the bar including the ones that your group fought in the bar.  
*You lost your King's Scroll and weapon when caught*  
> Go into jail for scroll and weapons  
  
You continued to pull Anrial through the town to find that jail. You have no idea where those criminals from your party went but hopefully they will be near. Through the town and past the screaming people, you found the jail and entered inside. It was strangely empty though, maybe lucky for you. You did hear familiar yelling from below.  
> Look behind the counter  
  
You looked behind the counter but found nothing except some useless paper. You did find a set of keys, probably extras. You take it anyways. Anrial left to go downstairs to check out the yelling.  
> Read the paper  
  
You read the paper seeing that you are already holding it. Nothing really special on it besides it saying... Horace? Why is your name on it?  
"...Rumor that a Knight named Horace from the kingdom of Nodok. Kill him and you shall be saved from my coming army and be rewarded. Of course the monsters through the way shall stop him and give me time to prepare but if you could,  I want him gone."  
It doesn't have a signature. You feel conflicted about this.  
> Look in the back room  
  
You left the paper on the counter and left to the back room. What you find there are weapon racks and other items. There you find your bone axe in a bin, probably a trash can. You also found a small scroll. You checked it and it seems to be yours.  
> Take the axe  
  
You decide to take the bone axe back again. You picks it up and felt the sharp jaw on it. It may not be good but it is yours that you made.  
When you got back to the main lobby, you saw Anrial trying to look for something under the counter.  
> Ask Anrial  
  
"I'm looking for a key. Isik, Paul, and Saul are down there in a cell."  
> Look downstairs  
  
You walked downstairs with the steps creaking. Anrial follows you down where you find Isik sleeping on the bed with the twins sitting nearby. You went to open the cell with the key and it does open. The twins slowly make their way out but Isik doesn't get up from the bed. You got close to Isik and saw that he was in a lot of damage. His cheek is puffed and bleeding. His nose is not straight. His fists are covered in blood. They did a number on this poor fool. You tried waking him up by gently pushing him around but he doesn't wake.  
> Persist waking him up  
  
You continued to push around Isik hoping he wakes up. Eventually he opens his eyes and makes a grunting noise.  
"Hmm... what do you want? Oh... you... I'm... You should have helped"  
He showed his arm. There was two nasty holes in it with blood pouring out.   
"Well... at least you came back. Probably still want your money's worth though... Where we going?"  
You thought about where to go while Isik slowly gets up and feelings his arm with the holes in them.  
> Look for a doctor  
  
Isik stumbles out of the cell and held onto Anrial but you can tell he didn't want to touch her. You went up the stairs with the twins in front, Anrial seems to be the only one is good shape. Nobody still in the lobby luckily. The fresh air hits you like a donkey kick. It certainly feels a lot better out here than in there where it reeks of urine. Because you are in bad shape, the people around you don't seem to be as fearful but they do gather around you like vultures. You did find the doctor's office but it appears to be a long line coming out of the office.  
> Find another way in  
  
You were in such bad shape that you needed to find another way in. You looked all around for a door but couldn't find a way in. The only places that you found was a few windows in the first story and a window at the second story next to a tree. The window in the first story lead inside what look's like a patient's room.  
> Climb the tree into the window  
  
You left the other party members down there while you climb the tree hoping to convince the doctor to help you first or to steal some things. You continued to climb the tree while your party distract the townsfolk from watching you. You manage to get onto the top where you need to climb the branch into the window. You slowly crawl your way into the edge of the branch and open then window. You open it but suddenly, there is a crack  
  
(reaction minigame)  
  
You dive through the window as the branch breaks. Surely a fall like that would have hurt you.  
You made it to what looks like an attic full of medical supplies. There is also a hatch that led downstairs, possibly cutting through and getting the attention of a doctor.  
> Steal medical supplies  
  
You didn't know what some of these things were but you can only guess. You took out a various items from each crate and stuffed them into a small bag you found, clipping it onto your belt. You as you were about to leave, you were stop by the sound of the hatch opening. Someone is coming  
> Release spores into the room and hide  
  
You took out the paw from your rotting hand which easily slipped off. The mushrooms inside the hole of your arm is agitated and pours spores all over the place. You spray it onto the ceiling so it rains down. Then you hide behind a box. As soon as a person walked upstairs, they found the room covered in spores. You can hear them cough loudly.  
"Dang, I can't see with all this dust here. What even happened?"  
The person covered in shadow looks around.  
"Oh, the stupid window."  
They close the window then leave while coughing.  
"Sorry Mary, I can't see. You gotta wait for it to settle upstairs."  
The hatch closes. You think you got enough medicine. You opened the window and looked outside, you saw your party looking up at you.  
> Jump to the tree  
  
You jump to the tree to help you slide down but as it turns out, you are not a goat and you just slam into the tree. Luckily you had a cushion of Anrial helping you.  
> Heal  
  
Health 10/15  
  
(reaction minigame for bonus health)  
  
Health 13/15  
You are surprisingly good at fixing wounds  
Where would you like to go?  
> Leave Gillerd  
  
You gathered all of you team to join you on the expedition towards Pomm. Walking to the other end of town, you had to dodge guards and run through a couple of people that tried to stop you but nothing that impeded your progress. You make it to the other end of Gillerd where you find a long open plain. This is going to be a long day. You went on your way through the the plains, finding nothing much of notes except for deers, foxes, and dogs fighting each other for food in this scarce land. You felt watched as the animals stared you down from afar but your axe can keep you safe. You continue walking through until you find a long river in width. Usually there would be a bridge here and there is but it is blocked by some presumably Gillerd guards.  
> Find another way  
  
You looked to find another way across the river by going both up and down the river but it seemed to go on endlessly. The bridge seems like the only way through unless you could think of another way.  
> Try to pass the bridge peacefully  
  
You told your party to stay calm and try to pass the bridge without any issues. You walked back to the bridge and saw those guards' smiles beam at you.  
"Yes sir, this is the only way."  
You grumbled. They continued talking as you grew closer.  
"What happened to that guy? Did he mess with a fox and coulnd't handle it? HA!"  
These guys are getting on your and Isik's nerves. Fortunately after healing the party, you could be in better shape to fight.  
"Hoo man... anyways, you need to pay 5 G. One for each, obviously."  
You have 10 G  
> Present royal scroll  
  
You smugly showed the Nodok scroll to the guards. Sure they must let you through... right?  
"Oh sorry Knight Horace, you can pass on through. Don't um... tell this to His Majesty. We get our stuff from there."  
You go through the bridge without paying.  
You went through the plans and find yourself in a small forest. Deers roamed the area, the ground curves, Saul stepped on a snake. You think about making camp soon.  
> Find a cave  
  
One of the deers look at you then walks away.  
  
You decide to try to find a cave somewhere to make camp. It would be a nice cool area to sleep in. You and your party had to stray from the path but luckily Anrial made breadcrumbs by dragging a trail to the path to find it when you come back. You did find cave but it seems to be occupied by a bear. It wakes up when you made noises, it growling to signify you are too close. There doesn't seem to be any other caves around besides this one.  
> Camp on a hill  
  
Deciding that you shouldn't mess with one of nature's most aggressive beasts, maybe staring at the night sky would be better. This hilly place could help you get an angle on any would be predators and it also made you very tired. You find a nice spot where there aren't any other hills and relatively close to the path. A campfire is prepared and you are tasked to help bring fire wood with the twins going by themselves for fire wood as well. The others are preparing the camp and placing your bags.  
You grab some twigs and long sticks that you think can help. Plenty of...  
What was that whooshing sound?  
  
(reaction minigame)  
  
An axe swings against the tree and is yanks back to the depth of the darkness  
The Deer(?) is swinging the axe around.  
Your health is 13/15  
> Attack torso with bone axe  
  
**Anrial is missing**  
**Isik is missing**  
**The Twins are missing**  
The Deer(?) swings the axe. It hits the tree next to you.  
You attacked the Deer(?) torso. Major damage  
  
The Deer(?) is laughing in a deep voice.  
Your health is 13/15  
> Call for help  
  
**Anrial is missing**  
**Isik is missing**  
**The Twins are missing**  
The Deer(?) swings the axe. It slices your right arm.   
*Less damage for 1 turn*  
You yelled for help  
  
(reaction minigame, failed)  
  
*The Deer(?) fled the battle*  
Health: 5/15  
The party came rushing to help with their weapons out but see no one. Anrial looks at your right arm.  
"What happened? Are you okay?"  
> Tell them about the Deer(?)  
  
You explained in great detail that there is a deer that is trying to kill you and it almost did. It chopped off your arm or ate it or something and it has been hounding you ever sense. The party nods but you get the feeling they don't think it is real. You walk back to camp anyways to heal your wound. You didn't find any good food, just rations to eat. You slept the night away.  
*Autosaving...*  
Health: 9/15  
You wake up to the smell of venison on the fire. It smells delicious. You see the twins fighting over who can turn it while Anrial and Isik are packing their stuff away.  
  
Anrial looks at you concerned.  
"We killed that deer you talked about. It's about to be eaten. Would you want some?"  
> Eat  
  
You want some food. Some extra fresh food would be good then the salted meat you usually eat. While eating you think about the axe you had that the deer stole. You look around for that axe but you don't see it. You ask where is your Chain Axe™️  
"It had an axe?" asked Isik who finished packing up  
> Explain that we lost an arm BECAUSE OF THE DEER  
  
You were yelling how you lost your arm due to the deer attack and cannot believe they would miss an axe like that. You even showed them your wound in greater detail which now has healed from eating and sleeping. Anrial thinks about saying something but is cut off my Isik.  
"Kid, we just killed a random deer. We don't know what you are talking about and just said it is that deer."  
"I know you lost your arm to something and I don't believe a deer can do that but I do believe something did that to you and we will find it."  
> Go into the woods to lure that `CENSORED` out  
  
Health 12/15 (+3 from eating food)  
You told the party to follow you to the woods. They all look at each other buy follow you anyways because you are the leader. You can overhear Saul and Paul laugh quietly.  
*How do you attract the deer?*  
> Whistle  
  
You stuck two fingers into you mouth and blew as hard you can. You look around and saw nothing. You whistled again and this time a couple of deers, squirrels, birds, walked into your view but none of them has an axe on them.  
> Set out some meat  
  
You threw out some meat onto the ground. The noise startles them and some of them leave. You wait for a while... some of the animals still stay, probably watching you but some leave by being scared or by being bored.  
> Act like we're distracted by something  
  
You turned around despite you fearing what is behind you and spoke to the party. You asked them how about that weather.  
> Tell the party to hide and watch from afar  
  
You told the party to walk back and to study from afar while you are the main bait  
While the party's back is turned going to hide reluctantly, you continued staring at the animals.   
The deer on the left winks then runs off.  
> CHASE THAT FOOL  
  
You chase the deer without a second thought. The party now in their positions are suddenly told to run after with you. They ready their weapons and run with you. The chase is on  
You didn't really think about it but a four legged creature is much faster than a human with two legs. You have a hard time catching up. The party is having a hard time even catching up with you.  
In the distance you see the deer running. It looks back at you for a second and has a strange human smile. You lose focus and start to trumble on tree roots  
  
(reaction minigame)  
  
You did tumble but you make a comeback, rolling and kept on running. You hear the wind blowing in your ears, the noises of the silent forest, the cracks of the twigs and leaves. That deer is fast. You are losing the deer...  
> Follow flying leaves  
  
You follow the flying leaves, whatever came past here was in a hurry but what you saw in the distance let you down, a running fox after a squirrel. You thought about why would the party laughing at you not be behind you.  
> Follow the laugher!!!!! QUICKLY!!!  
  
You ran back and followed the laughter, your party finally reached you as you you came back towards them and to the right instead. But what you find is an open cliff. It was trapped here! You threw your axe down to the ground in anger.  
Your party is wheezing and holding their sides. Isik is holding where he was stabbed but you feel fine as if you could run another few miles.  
"S... stop... Hor... Horace..."  
You looked around the area but to your dismay, there was no evidence except for a cut on the edge of the cliff which looked human. You looked down and saw a bipedal deer running into the forest down below. It dissapears between through the trees.  
> Climb down quickly  
  
You... will not make that. You have to go a long way around  
You tried going back down the large hill to make it to the forest below but Isik stops you.  
"Stop! We gone too far. We will not follow you if you keep this up. Your delusions are going to get us killed."  
Anrial sadly looks at you and shakes her head  
"You found that deer twice now. You can find it again. Let's just go back..."  
> WE ARE GETTING THAT DAMN DEER  
  
"I'm not paid for this. I paid to kill a necromancer, not frollic through the forest."  
> "ok then go back to camp"  
  
"Then you will do this alone. We will see you there... or not."  
They sigh after this tension and walk back where they came from  
> Continue the deer chase  
  
You walked down the hill solemnly. You will bring back the head of that deer if it is the last thing you do... it may be the last thing you do. It took you a while but you made it around the hill into the forest below. You find it to be a lot more foreboding than the forest up the hill where the camp is. You also may be lost. You only know the deer went away from the hill but other than that, it could be anywhere. You heard howling and growling, not sure what noises they are.  
> Follow the howling  
  
You follow the howling noises, expecting there to be some sort of evidence for the deer. Maybe there would be a dead wolf. You went through the forest following those howling noises that happen preriodically. You find a group of wolves circling an antelope that seemed to have gotten lost here.  
> Watch  
  
You sat back from afar, watching the wolves circle the antelope. You hope it is that deer from before but why would it change species now? Wouldn't those creatures be dead by now? You must've missed what happened because all of a sudden, the wolves are on the back of the antelope, chewing on the back and clawing the sides. You can see bloody strips worm their way up the paw. The antelope falls to the ground while the pack feasts on the sides and belly of the prey while it is still alive. It will soon die like this, such is the way of life.  
> Follow where you think the growling is  
  
You aren't sure where that growling came from but you went to where you heard it first time then followed the direction of the loud growling. You don't know if a deer could make that noise but you had to check anyways. But what you found shocked you. A disemboweled bear through the stomach. What could have done this?  
> Inspect  
  
You aren't an expert of hunting so you can't really find anything  
> Just look around  
  
You looked at the dead bear and saw that there is just a single slash across the chest with its organs missing. Not even a claw mark, a clean slash  
You look around the surroundings to see if that deer is staring at you. You don't find any deers, in fact, no animals around. This is bear territory after all.  
> Keep inspecting  
  
You kept inspecting the area. You do find a blood trail leading deeper to the forest. Finding that piece of evidence, you come across a small lake where the blood trail ends. You look around and see nothing except fish in the water  
> Head back  
  
Finally that piece of mind lets the deer go... at least for now. You want to leave and meet your party again... Passing through the cliff side then going up, you find landmarks that tells you where you are. It takes you a lot of the day but you find the camp where the party is at. You see Isik sleeping and Anrial pouring water on her face and washing it. The twins are playing some game where they throw rocks at each other, their faces bleeding but they are laughing.  
Anrial sees you  
"Oh Horace! How did the hunt go?"  
> Tell her about the bear  
  
Horace tells the nasty description about the bear that was sliced open. She looks shocked  
"What could have done that?"  
> "A chain axe"   
  
"I suppose a chain axe could have done that..."  
She looks away as she says that   
> Attempt speaking to the fungus network to ask if they've seen the deer  
  
You look around the place for a fungus. You spot a mushroom near a tree where you touch it. You feel it and instantly fainted.  
...  
You wake up with Anrial slapping a wet cloth on your face, washing it.   
"You alright?"  
Horace tells her that you felt overloaded with information.  
"Um, well now that you are alright, what do we do now?"  
> "Stay on guard dont let that.. thing ambush us"  
  
She looks down and says  
"Yeah um... alright."  
"We finished packing up when you got here. We just kinda rested while you were away then packed up when you got here. I think we can make it to the next town."  
Paul waves his hand over your face to get your attention  
> Go to the next town  
  
You suppose staying in the forest was long enough so off you went to the next town. You do not know the name of the towns around here much like your party members. They usually lived in Nodok. This is their first time traveling around the place and it is very exciting for you as well.  
You think about of all the creatures and people you encountered and wondered if you will meet them again some day like that Fire Mage that never gave his name.  
You see deers and squirrels run past the path you are walking on causing a few hiccups as you want them to scram out of the way.  
But soon you made it to the town of Wult  
You find six guards at the entrance though. One of them speaks in a monotone voice.  
"Hello. Welcome to Wult. Enjoy your stay."  
How nice of them. Usually a lot of them are power hungry. You entered the town of Wult and find the town busy as other towns would be  
You did find it unusual that everyone is so organized walking around in lines to their stores or wherever they go.  
(12/15 HP)  
> Enter a weapon store  
  
Considering how you do not have a weapon, you tried entering the weapon store... but it appears to be locked. Strange, usually it would be open at a time like this but I suppose the owners are on break.  
> Go to the blacksmith  
  
You left to the blacksmith and found it to be open. At least something is open  
The man welcomes you to the blacksmith but after greeting you to the town. He too has a monotone voice.  
"Hello. Welcome to Wult. Enjoy your stay. Please give us your weapons to inspect. Take a complimentary drink. Both free of charge."   
> Get out of here  
  
You said nothing and tried to leave through the door... but it is locked? When did this happen?  
"I insist. Free of charge. Give us your weapon."  
> Bust the door down  
  
You ordered the party to together break down the door.  
"I insist. Free of charge. Lay down your weapon."  
The blacksmith wield a warhammer  
> Defend the party  
  
The Blacksmith (Civilian) protects his shop.  
Your health is 12/15  
> Nice argument, however... 🍄💨 SPORE BLAST  
  
Anrial is attacking Door  
The Twins are attacking Door  
Isik is attacking door  
The Blacksmith (Civilian) spins around. He misses  
You activated Spore Blast. It didn't seem to work  
  
The Blacksmith (Civilian) protects his shop.  
Your health is 12/15  
> Attack door using weapon  
  
Anrial is attacking Door  
The Twins are attacking Door  
Isik is attacking door  
The Blacksmith (Civilian) swings wildly. He hits Saul in the back.  
*Saul takes major damage.*  
You attacked Door  
  
The door breaks open...  
But what you see before you in a crowd of guards, people, children all limping their way towards you. They all have a cup of liquid in their hand while making their way to you.  Both sides of you are blocked by the crowd of people  
> Run through  
  
You grabbed Anrial and practically slide her across the ground while the the criminals are having a hard time catching up. Luckily there was enough space for you to run through. You look back to see a small group still walking towards you but you don't see Isik or the twins.  
You heard some screaming  
> Check for the criminals  
  
All you continually hear being chanted is  
"Welcome to Wult. Free of charge. I insist."  
> Attack the crowd passively  
  
You use a mixture of spores and the blunt side of the axe to force your way through the group that was following you to find the crime gang that was with you. Spores are shot out like rain. Eyes water but they continue to walk to where they last saw you. Even though it doesn't stop them, they walk past you thinking you are still somewhere you are not.  
You find Isik clutching the side of his shoulder that was previously stabbed  
"GO MOVE NOW!"  
He runs to behind a building  
> Follow Isik  
  
You followed Isik to the back of the building where you see him still moving and looking around the corners. He looks back and readies his sword but lets down.   
"They got Paul and Saul."   
> What happened and where   
   
Isik rubs his face. You can tell he doesn't know what to do.   
"I DONT KNOW! One of them was hurt by that angry blacksmith guy and had a hard time moving and the other was carrying him and I was trying to push past them but they got lost. I looked back and saw them forcing their mouths open to drink from that cup. I don't know where they are. I DONT KNOW ANY PLAN! Uh uh, the plan is to run away from this place!"   
> Agree with your plan   
   
You decide to leave the fates of the twins to the town.   
You, Isik, and Anrial ran over to where you entered this place and saw it still filled with those six guards from earlier. Isik expresses his doubts.   
> Flee   
   
The now smaller team runs through the town to look for another exit but finds any possible exits to be closed off by barricades, gates, or guards. All while they sneak past the somehow growing population of people.   
> Fungi spore the air in the town   
   
You held the team back and decided to try to send spores everywhere. Your paw unhinges but fully falls off. I'm sure that won't be a problem. You shot out spores but not enough to do any damage to the town, just to people individually.   
> Tell isik and anrial to run to uhmm   
   
"What about Saul and Paul?"   
> "What are we gonna do against a whole town!?"   
   
Isik interjects   
"What if we um..."   
"I'm thinking"   
"What if we hide somewhere and leave when it is night through the guard area? And maybe we um... we find the twins and take them away from here?"   
> "Are you sure they arent.. brainwashed already??"   
   
Anrial  is bawling at this point, covering her eyes. Isik continues to talk.   
"WE DONT KNOW THAT! What if they still need to do something like a uhhhh... ritual? Or maybe it takes a while or maybe we can reverse it or- We need to get them."   
He is covering both sides of his head with his hands.   
"I don't even know a good spot here."   
> Hide in abandoned building   
   
Isik looks around the corner then immediately backs off.    
"I'm looking for a place to be safe in."   
He continues looking around the corner when into an alleyway when suddenly he gets his sword out. A man holding a cup of... juice walks towards you. Isik is hiding on a wall while the man is focused on you. Isik then smacks the temple of the man using the handle of the sword, immediately crippling him.   
"We need to be careful"   
> Follow Isik   
   
The team followed behind Isik while he moved in the alleyway. He see him looked out in the open of town and waited for a few moments. You suspect he is watching for a good chance to get across town. You wait for a minute or so while you watch a crowd of people walk past down the street. Then Isik waves his hand over. He runs across the street where you and Anrial follows him. This might take a while if you need to get somewhere far but luckily there are abandoned buildings everywhere that are assumingly because of the cult like people. Isik continues to lead through the alleyways and small streets when they find a small group of people staring down an alleyway while holding a torch. You don't know what they are doing. Occasionally someone from the street will say hello then they will say hello back.   
> Sneak past   
   
You tried to sneak past them. Hopefully they won't notice your presence. Being in the city is bad but you cannot find a way out of here. Hopefully having higher ground will give you more information. You make it to an abandoned two story building that looks like a store. The doors and windows are boarded up so you have to break off a window barricade to get it in side the front entrance is too dangerous. There doesn't seem to be much in here save for a few items that aren't worthy to take but this can be your temporary camp.   
> Barricade this place more   
   
You pushed shelves over windows, pressed tables over doors, you found a giant pot and found liquid in there but decide to push it against a window.   
> Go upstairs   
   
Isik continues to push furniture, chairs, and tables to the windows and doors, you and Anrial went upstairs. It reeks of death up here. You aren't sure what you will find up here but it might be something good. As you walk upstairs, you almost slip. There is a dark oozing liquid pouring down. You aren't sure what to make of this. You got to the top and see a door with a pool of liquid pouring from underneath. You tried the door knob and it seems to be unlocked.   
> Gently open it   
   
Afraid that you might fight, you want to sneak your way inside. You slowly open the door and get hit by a wave of smells. You almost throw up but manage to keep your food in your stomach. The rooms is incredible but at the end of the room is disgusting. There is a man at the end of the room sitting down with his mouth open with a glowing green liquid coming out from his mouth. The man is wearing a robe with circular spectacles.    
> Look at the dead man   
   
You pushed the head of the dead man. The liquid coming from his mouth wouldn't stop flowing. You felt like you were being watched. You don't know how this man died but whatever it is really messed him up. He look at his face...   
His eyes moved to look at you.   
> Look around   
   
Creeped out by the man, you look around the place and notice it filled with flasks containing fluids inside of them. Some of them fell to the floor and mix together. That's what the mysterious ooze going downstairs is.   
> Inspect flasks  
  
Checking out the flasks, you tried to pick up some of them that fell to the ground, one of the was stuck to the ground, another was floating just a bit above the ground, and another perpetually spinning. There were names on them but it appeared to be in runes. You heard pounding coming up stairs.  
> Get our weapon ready  
  
Feeling very paranoid, you took out your Bone Axe in case any enemies show up. The door opens.  
> ATTACK!  
  
You attack whatever is coming through the door. You immediately hit Anrial  
"OW WHY?"  
> Frantically apologize  
  
"GOD OW"  
You frantically apologize for attacking her. Luckily, your weapon isn't that strong due to it being crafted out of bones so damage was minimal.  
"Yeah yeah, I understand but my God that really hurt. You are almost as crazy as... what is going on up here?"  
She looks at the dead body  
> Say sorry again, then say we don't know what happened to the body  
  
"I accept your apology but please next time be careful. I might need a bandage for this."  
You told her about what you know about the body but not really sure what to make of it. She grew closer to the body. She looks disgusted yet fascinated by it. You saw its arm twitch  
> Nudge Anrial away  
  
You quickly got up to Anrial to move her out of the way. You still feel bad about hurting her so you are being careful. You grabbed her to move her but she doesn't move any further, you hear her panic.  
"THE THING HAS ME! IT- GET IT OFF!"  
> Pull her and cut the arm  
  
You kept yanking Anrial to get a clear shot of the arm and tried grabbing your axe with your other hand which is a paw but as you tried to grab it, you remembered... You lost the paw when it fell right off during the time you were looking for a way out of the city. You watched in horror as the body grabs Anrial and pulls her towards it. It has both arms around her.  
> Chop the arm from the shoulder area  
  
You tried chopping the shoulder with your one hand but every time you tried, the body moves Anrial to the side you are on.  
The eyes stare straight through you  
> Use our hand to pull the decaying corpse's arm  
  
You holsters your axe and went to grab the arm of the corpse. It still carried Anrial around the sides you were on but you grab the forearm anyways. You start to yank on it. You can hear the sickening stretch of muscles being ripped and old bones cracking. The other hand grabs you. It is trying to pull you in with Anrial!  
  
(reaction minigame)  
  
You pull away from the arm. You completely ripped it off while the other arm stops trying to pull you. It still has Anrial but she manages to wiggle her way out. You can hear the corpse groaning while you both move away. Anrial hugs you tightly.  
> Kill(?) the corpse  
  
You took out your axe and got ready to chop its head off. You spun the Bone Axe around, ready to slice but before you could. You corpse made a stopping hand gesture then pointed at something.  
> Tell Anrial to look, wouldn't want to fall to the oldest trick in the book  
  
You heard the body groan while you put the axe up to the corpse's neck. You told Anrial to look at where it is pointing. She shakes as she moves over. You cannot tell where it is pointing but you hope Anrial is getting it. She came back and showed off an closed light blue glowing bottle. The groaning body still spewing liquid makes cracking and gurgling noises as its arm you didn't cut off points it to its mouth.  
Your rotting arm falls off completely.  
> Call Isik to make him drink it  
  
You yelled to Isik to come upstairs. You heard some fast pounding getting closer before a louder crash. You heard him curse.  
"GOD DANG IT WHO PUT WATER HERE?"  
He mumbles as he opens the doors and closes his nose.  
"What's going on?"   
> Change of plan, ask him if we should drink it  
  
"You... you want to know if you should drink mysterious blue liquid? I shouldn't be surprised at this point. It's like telling a toddler to not eat ants. No, you shouldn't drink it. Why?"  
> "corpse over here pointed to it"  
  
"The chances of it being poison outweighs the- what?"  
> "The corpse."  
  
"What are you talking about"  
> Point to the corpse(?)  
  
"Is this that deer thing again?"  
Isik looks over to the corpse and saw it pointing still  
"Ew, don't uh, touch corpses either"  
> Give the potion to the corpse  
  
"You... you want the corpse to drink it?"  
> "Yes"  
  
Isik puts his hand on your stubbed shoulder which now doesn't have an arm anymore.  
I'm not a witch or a wizard but this feels like a bad idea but if curiousity gets the best of you, we can take out one corpse together. Isik takes out his blood encrusted short sword. Anrial takes out her bow and pulls it towards the corpse  
The corpse opens the palm of its hand.  
You open the bottle of blue liquid and place it on the hand of the corpse. It grabs it and yanks it right over, almost pulling you towards it. You watched it drink the liquid without any chugging noises which weirded you out. It just poured straight down the throat of the corpse. You readied your axe with your only hand.  
The corpse looks around robotically but the movements becomes smoother.  
The corpse places its hand on the ground to push itself up. The shriveled legs that you didn't notice before could barely hold the weight of the body. The eyes of the corpse stay focused on you while it stands up. You can head old bones snap and rotting meat fills your lungs. Anrial looks away to cover her face.  
> Back away  
  
The corpse fully stood up and it walking towards you  
> Wait  
  
You watched the corpse clamber closer towards you like a dying animal.  
Your weapons falter as an undead grew closer then stopped right in front of you. It's mouth completely still open, dragging the fluids spewing out of it over. It speaks  
"Th... thank... you..."  
Isik curses  
> Can we name him Martin?  
  
"I... name... do... not... remem... know..."  
> Put a fungus on him so we can check on him  
  
You place a fungus on him, the mushroom immediately starts to suck out the nutrients from him  
> REMOVE IT  
  
You quickly remove it  
What do you ask of the corpse?  
> Ask about the creepy cultists  
  
Anrial and Isik still has their weapons ready  
"I... know... them..."  
> Ask if it wants to be friends with us  
  
It has to open and close its mouth with his only arm  
"Friends.............. y... yes...."  
"Live... now... you..."  
"The... the... people...... "  
What else would you like to ask of the... zombie?  
> Ask zombie if he will come with us  
  
"No... scared... of.... them..."  
> Ask about the flasks  
  
"Mine..."  
He speaks this in a gravely voice  
> "What do they do?"  
  
"Save... me... save... them... may... be...  
> Tell him to follow us  
  
"Scared..."  
> Tell him we will protect him  
  
"Them..."  
"No... Stay... They... Find... Us... If... Leave..."  
> "The flasks will save you?"  
  
"Saved..."  
"Give.... them... drink... they... free..."  
> Say thanks and grab the flasks  
  
"Take.......... Careful..."  
"Fire... Fire......."  
Anything else you wish to ask him?  
> "Do you know anything about magic?"  
  
"Yes... no... gem....."  
> "Do they have magic?"  
  
"Yes... but... lost... gems..."  
> "Could we throw the potions at the brainwashed"  
  
The corpse practically throws himself at you  
"NO...!"  
"Do... not... remem... ber... good... drink... All... drinks... bad... but... one..."  
There seems to be 20 filled flasks with more in the back that are empty.  
"Do.... not... remem... ber..."  
The flasks are: 1 purple, 2 blues, 1 light blue, 4 red, 3 greens, 5 yellow, 4 whites  
> The liquid we gave earlier was blue and there is only 1 good liquid, take the bright blue flask  
  
Thinking that you got it, you take the light blue flask while Anrial watches the corpse move around. Isik still has his sword out.  
"It... had... blue..."  
The corpse has trouble standing up  
"You... cour... age... I... never... had..."  
"Thank... you..."  
The corpse sits down where it once was.  It points to something that looks like a covered crate.  
> Inspect  
  
You check the covered crate and take off the blanket. It seems to be full of empty flasks. You look over at the corpse who is holding a key of some kind.  
> Take the key gently  
  
You take the key but you aren't sure what it is for  
> "What is this for?"  
  
"Open... hatch... and... mon... ey..."  
> Look for hatch on the floor  
  
The corpse scratches his cheek, a piece of flesh falls off.  
You look all around the floor, and ever tried to check where he once was sitting by gently moving him but there doesn't seem to be any safes. The corpse continues to point at the crates that were covered  
> Push the crates to the side  
  
You push the crates to the side and find a small hatch attached to the walls. You open it and find a small piece of jewelry such as necklaces, rings, and bracelets. You also found a drawing of a man in robes holding a flask looking away.  
*You earned 10 G*  
The corpse would smile if it could  
Isik and Anrial stops looking at the corpse and stares at you.  
"What happens now?"  
> "...No clue.."  
  
The corpse walks over to the door to go downstairs. You can hear aggressive quick pounding of the stairs.  
You follow the corpse down as you don't have any idea what to do  
You find the corpse fallen over and trying to get up. He must've fell  
> Help him up  
  
He eventually gets up then walks over to a chair that was still on the floor.  
> Set zombie's name to Martin  
  
"My... name... is... Marteen..."  
> "our name is horace"  
  
"Horash"  
"Horath"  
"Horis"  
"Horis... Marteen"  
The zombie stumbles over to the boarded window and tries to push the barricades you made out of the way but he seems to be having problems  
> Ask him if he needs help  
  
"Yes..."  
You and Anrial push the barricades out of the way while Isik keeps watch through the windows. You felt weird about moving the barricades out of the way when you just put them there but he wants to look outside. You see Martin look out the window but he makes a noise then leaves. He moves over to another window and pushes those barricades out of the way.  
> Help  
  
You helped out Martin push the barricades out of the way with Anrial but she voices that she doesn't want the cultists to see us but you figured Martin is doing this for a reason. You push tables and chairs out of the way to let in daylight that is slowly getting dimmer. After you are finished, Martin moves close to the ground, enough that his face is pressing against it. Black blood spills against the glass. He is pointing to something. You press your face against the window and see that he is pointing to a cross of some kind.  
"Follow... drop... drink... save... them... night..."  
Isik, now in your view, nods his head.  
*How shall you prepare?*

\[...\]  
  
You clapped as hard as you can. Isik groggily gets up. The twin's head knock into each other   
Martin stands up straight. Anrial quickly closes her journal   
> Go to Gillerd   
   
You told everyone you are going back to Gillerd. Isik groans and the twins goes back to sleep.   
Martin however asks: "Isn't th-that b-back where you c-came from?"   
You, still in fungal monster form, shook them around like a ragdoll until they fully wake up.   
Everyone is up and ready to leave.   
> Become human and head straight to Gillerd   
   
You tried feeling your gem on your right arm but remembered you still don't have a left arm so you just had to focus without touching it   
You did go back to human form but it did take a couple of minutes of pure thinking.   
When you came back to human form, you see everyone is ready to go now. You all climbed through the window and walk to the exit of Wult back to Gillerd.    
Ah, the great hilly forest. What a beautiful place. The twins and Martin have trouble moving up the hills but besides that, everything is fine... for now.   
You felt like you were being watched.   
You swear you saw something move through the trees. Must've been your imagination...   
You heard whatever it was, slithering around. You heard a loud hissing sound.   
Is that what you think it is... or something else?   
You thought about turning into a fungus while moving but find it hard to do so   
You have to stand still to do it... something was staring at you

> Make Martin some clothes with snake skin   
   
You take the time to skin the snake. As you are not an expert Hunter, you botch it badly but considering the amount of skin you can work with, you can get some usability. You folded, and stabbed through parts of the snake skin. It looks pretty bad but you got a torso snake shirt for Martin.  
  
\[...\]  
  
"We know one of you is Horace, so give him up now! You, it's you. I remember you punching me down in the cell."  
He points at Isik.   
> Flee  
  
You both decide to run off back into the plains. You do know that the river here cannot be crossed so you need to find another way into Gillerd or lose your plans. The guards did try to run after you guys and almost had Martin but luckily the Twins dragged him along.  
  
Wait, you didn't mean to do that. He looks at you bitter.  
Isik speaks bluntly to Martin  
"Horace punched a few people and destroyed the town high off Devil's Tornado"   
> "WHATEVER YOU DO MARTIN DO **NOT** DRINK THE DEVIL'S TORNADO"  
  
"I-I do not kn-know what that is b-but alright." "M-maybe i-if..."  
Martin's eyes pops out again. Anrial decides to speak up.  
"Why don't you show them the scroll?"   
> "We have already, they dont care"  
  
Saul speaks up and giggles. "Why don't we make our own bridge?"  
Paul pushes Saul. "Ooh, how about a boat to sail like... like pirates!"  
> Flee back to Wult  
  
\[...\]  
You walk up to Martin who is still staring at the note. He couldn't tell you were behind him until you cleared you throat. He doesn't look back  
"Wh-who are w-we v-visiting a-again?"   
> "A mage who might be able to make you stronger"  
  
"You m-mean Jamesworth?" "M-my b-brother"  
> "Did your brother use fire magic?"  
  
"H-he was a m-mage wh-who ran away f-from Nodok. H-he f-found a rock. H-he didn't know h-how to u-use it. H-he was scared..."  
"H-he c-caused the g-great ffffire of N-Nodok wh-which outlawed m-magic eeever s-since."  
"B-but th-they didn't k-know i-it was him. Th-they j-just know i-it was magic th-that did it"  
"J-James t-told me. He r-ran into my h-house and stayed th-there"  
"Th-then he left... I-I didn't k-know he l-lives here"  
Drops of blood fall from his eyes. He wipes them away  
The forest grew silent. You look back and see Jamesworth standing there with a large bag in... townsfolk clothing which looks off on him.  
> Wait for FM to say something  
  
He drops it and runs to Martin and gives him a hug. You don't think he even cares that Martin is a corpse.  
"Man you idiot, what did you do?"  
"D-drank bad p-potion."   
"Horas... Horace h-helped."  
The Fire Mage looks at the party. He seems to be crying. He bows down to his knee.  
"Is there anything I could do to help you?"  
> Ask FM if he could make Martin stronger so that he doesn't die on our adventurees  
  
"He messed up big time. He usually um... he had a bad habit of testing the potions. I told him he shouldn't do that but he likes doing it. And look where it got him. You are correct he is frail but he will not die. The necromancy drink will not kill him unless you give him a health potion. He was like this for a long time, I can tell. His wounds won't heal quickly enough when he comes... 'human' so he will have holes then he will die from that. He is better off like this."   
"Is there anything else you want me to help you with?"

> Ask the mage to come with us on our adventures to possibly get his name cleaned up  
  
"I-I am not in the greatest of shapes for adventuring."  
He emphasizes by showing off his wrinkled face.  
> "Neither of us are"  
  
"Aren't you a knight?"  
> "A Knight missing an arm"  
  
"Why don't you fix that again like you did last time?"  
"You used a rotting meat as your temporary arm when you made that Bone Axe"  
"You could go to the doctor's and ask for a prosthetic too."  
> Respect the mage's decision to not come along  
  
Jamesworth opens the hatch with a key and heads inside. You decide to wait outside while you he gets them for you. You do peek through and see him levitate up. After a few minutes, he comes back down with three potions.  
He hands you the three flasks which are light green, pink, and yellow colors.  
> Ask him about the potions  
  
As the mage gives you the potions, he explains what the pink one does.  
"This one here makes you angrier. You feel the rage in your heart and attack with ferocity."  
He tries explaining the other ones but Martin interrupts.  
"I-I got this one. Th-those are the same ones I-I gave y-you earlier. Y-yellow is focus a-and g-green is d-defense."  
The Fire Mage smiles and shakes his head as Martin interrupts him   
> Head onto the next town  
  
Everybody got ready to leave but before you could, the Fire Mage asks you to wait, it might not take that long so you stay anyways. It takes a minute or so but he comes back with a bright blue bird. He holds out the bird with one finger. "I want you to have this."  
> Take the bird  
  
"Once a day, throw the bird in the sky. It will come back to me and I will give it a potion. It is the least I can do after everything you did and me not being able to adventure with you."  
> Thank the mage  
  
You thank you mage by shaking his hand. He looks delighted. Martin also shakes his hand where it just falls off. The mage and Martin laughs it off.  
> Stay a little longer  
  
What would you like to do while you stay?  
> Ask Jamesworth about how he's been doing  
  
"It has been lonely honestly and quite frightening. I'm sure you noticed how paranoid I've been with the traps in the castle. I do feel bad about not going with you but I think it is for the best."  
"I... I was already going to do that."  
He said this sheepishly.  
"I was going to add notes to my bird and talk this way with you, um, when I added my potions."  
What would you like to do while you stay?  
> Ask Jamesworth what Martin's real name is  
  
Horace asks the Fire Mage what was his brother name?  
"You named him Martin? That's... well you wouldn't have known but his name is Jackie."  
Jackie looks astonished hearing this.  
"I-I did n-not know th-that! B-but they l-like the n-n-name Marteen. W-would it b-be fine to c-call me b-by my name? M-my real one."  
> Call him by his original name  
  
Considering that you now know his real name, it would be rude to call him by his name we gave him. Anrial shakes his hand and calls him by his real name Jackie. She seems to gotten use to his appearance now. The Twins just offer their disappointment because they liked the name Martin.  
What would you like to do while you stay?  
> Talk with Isik  
  
You look around for Isik but he still seems to be gone. You think he is making his round around the place still. You should go after him.  
> Wait 8 minutes outside the tower for Isik  
  
You decide to wait with the party for Isik to return. Around that time, Jamesworth said his goodbyes while Anrial and Jackie helped him with his groceries. Isik returns to find everyone sitting around talking.  
"So what happened?"  
Horace explains that you found the mage and Martin's name is Jackie and how they will stay like this but you got potions and a bird.  
"How did all of this happened when I was gone?"  
> Explain the series of events  
  
You explained the series of events  
You told him after you spoke with him, he waited for the mage to come back where he was found with groceries. They also found out he was the brother of Jackie and also the mage did some bad stuff in Nodok too. After returning his brother to him, he thanks us and gave us a bird to talk to him and gotten potions.  
> Also explain that we were worried that the Deer(?) got him  
  
Isik nods his head while you speak but you aren't sure if he really head what you said. "DON'T YOU KNOW HOW TO SHUT YOUR MOUTH"  
Everybody looks at you and Isik. "Are you possessed by something?" (Isik said that)  
> Wait for the party's reaction  
  
They party comes over to comfort you while Anrial gives Isik a handful. Isik just looks away, bored. Even the Twins tried comforting you the only way they know how, by trying to distract you but you were busy looking at Anrial  
You see Isik stare at you  
You felt his cold gaze go through you.  
After Anrial is finished she goes back after wiping her face. You don't know what she said but you think she released all of the stress she built up along the way. She is not the type to be adventuring through cults and being with criminals.  
Isik gestures you to come over by pointing at you then curling his finger multiple times  
Anrial keeps watch  
> Come over to Isik  
  
You hear him grunt as he looks up to the sky. He speaks this in a monotonous voice  
"I guess I should apologize. You are the leader and... we should follow you."  
> Accept the apology  
  
His voice gets quieter as he looks at you  
"I thought I told you to keep this deer thing a secret. Shut your stupid mouth."  
He continues to speak quietly  
"It's better if they don't know about it. I- hrng..."  
He speaks in his normal voice.  
"I am not going to speak about this anymore"  
> Ask nicely  
  
You ask nicely that you would like to know about your enemy. Isik stares at you and walks off to the group.  
"I don't know what you are talking about."  
> Insist  
  
You really want to know about the deer. Isik laughs at you and tells the group.  
"Listen to Horace speak about this deer again ha!"  
Anrial and Jackie laugh nerviously while the Twins chuckle.  
> Insist  
  
Isik starts to get mad  
"Alright Horace, this deer thing is getting annoying. Stop talking about it, joke or not. It is getting- stop talking about it."  
Isik points to Anrial.  
"You are scaring her about it that you are this crazy or that is exists."  
> Stop talking about it  
  
The others didn't notice since Isik was in front of the group but you see him smile. He looks back at the group and walks through. Anrial walks closer to you while playing with her hands and twisting a pen. The Twins chuckle nerviously now as he walks away.  
> Leave to Gillerd  
  
You gathered the team and begin their way to Gillerd. You told the Fire Mage goodbye one more time before fully making their way out. Deep in the forest, you find corpses all around the place including the giant snake. Terry will be eating good.  
> Pet the mushroom again and leave  
  
You pat the fungus happily. You can tell it liked that. You left on your way to Gillerd. Luckily though, on the way there, there was no encounters and events besides Jackie stumbling. You make it near the entrance of Gillerd where Anrial had a thought  
"Why don't I buy stuff for you? They are fine with me, I wasn't put in jail."

"I want to buy some um... better armor for two or three of us if that is fine for you."  
She leaves into the town of Gillerd where you lose sight of her as she goes down the entrance of the town. You do not dare to go any farther down in case you get caught. You look at your party members and still see Isik eying at you, gazing through you. After several minutes of the party talking, Anrial comes back with one Studded Leather armor and one Padded armor. You do not know the difference and even if there is a difference between them. Who gets what? Anrial does say the hide armor was cheaper than the armor she got.
