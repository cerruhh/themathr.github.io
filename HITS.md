# Horror ITS
Thunder strikes through the broken roof of this decrepit house. Rain pouring through the hallways of this broken down home. Water leaking through the doorway into your room. The moth eaten bed full of holes is barely better than the floor you are on. There is a fallen wardrobe that you pushed against the doorway but that will do little to stop the monsters from getting to you.  
> Go back to sleep  
  
You decide to go back to sleep. You are protected enough in this house.  
A few more hours here in this house...  
You can feel yourself drift through happy memories you once had before this... event happened.  
It quickly turns into a nightmare and you force yourself to wake up  
You are up again with no will to sleep but at least the rain is gone  
> Check the room  
  
This room carries a scent of musty air with no one being here in a long time. There are clothes around on the floor that look worn from the erosion of the weather  
Perhaps you could use some of these clothes  
  
There are some shoes you could use  
```
Mismatched shoes - It appears to be the same brand of shoes, just different colors. There is a hole in one of the shoes.  
```
> Take  
  
```
Torn pants - This used to be something you wore happily but it is covered in plastic wrap now.  
T-shirt - You don’t know what logo this is supposed to be.  
```
> Check for creature hiding in shoes  
  
There is a dead rat inside  
This is honestly better than the food you have on you right now  
You think about what you have on your person.  
> Check stats

> Do not eat the bottle  
  
  
You decide to not eat the bottle. Perhaps it is now time to leave or you could check around some more  
> Leave  
  
The team leaves the room by pulling up the fallen wardrobe upright and opening the door. You stand in the soggy carpet and look up. There is a hole in the roof pouring water in. You didn't look around this house so it may have things inside  
You checked the room you were in but not the other parts of the house  
> Go to right room  
  
You decide to go to the next room but it seems to be locked from the inside.  
> Go downstairs  
  
Usually there is something in the basement as that is very secure.  
You walk down the steps with the stairs making creaking noises. You slip as it breaks from under you. You hit the ground.  
You get back up soggy from the rain water going down here. You can't quite see what is down here. You saw something move in the corner of your eye...  
You swear you saw something but...  
> Inspect the room  
  
It must have been your imagination. You look around the basement with water going up to your ankles. You see empty bottles on the shelves  
> Drink the water  
  
You drink the water.  
```
Your wounds are being unraveled. You are losing health gradually.  
```
You feel like throwing up...  
You kneel down and throw up. The puke floats on the water around your thighs soaking it in. There is some blood in it.  
> Get back up  
  
You get back up trying your best to not eat it. That blood was important...  
Something touches you from behind  
  
*The shadow is attacking!*  
> Attack head  
  
You punch the head your shadow. It dissapates.  
Must be what you saw earlier.  
> Look around the basement more  
  
You look around, checking the shelves. You found a screwdriver.  
> Take the screwdriver  
  
You take the screwdriver. This will always be useful. There is nothing around here anymore besides the shadow following you. You decide to go back up as there is nothing here  
> Take left door  
  
The door opens with a crusty slime on the other side trying to keep you out. This looks to be a kitchen of some kind.  
> Bottle the slime and enter  
  
There is a bloated body on the table that is excreting this slime. Must've been here for a while.  
> Check the body  
  
It looks to be a woman. You try turning her over but she is stuck to the table.  
> Use screwdriver to force it  
  
You slide your screwdriver under her body, cutting the crunchy slime away between the body and the table. She slides off the table leaving behind a pair of keys  
> Take them for later and check the kitchen  
  
The fridge is hard to open. You almost puke from the smell of the odors inside. You find a bottle of old water and a molding loaf of bread that can still be somewhat useable  
> Take  
  
You decide to leave the kitchen as there is nothing left here.  
> Go to right room  
  
You open the right room using the key. It unlocks  
You open the door as see a timeless room if not for the mold and the spiders. It looks quite pleasant here like life was back to normal. Checking the room out you can find a wardrobe full of clothes that you may need and some valuables around here.  
> Take it all and examine

```
A broken pocket watch - It seems to be a regular wristwatch without the straps. It is also cracked and the time seems to be off. Luckily you can always rewind it.  
Phones - Maybe you can turn it on to see a password lock if you are lucky   
```
> Rewind the watch  
  
The time is set back a minute on the watch  
> Check the wardrobe  
  
There is a spider web that rips when you open the wardrobe. Luckily the clothes here are in good shape  
```
Cloth hoodie - It is too small for you but it keeps the cold away.  
Formal outfit - Dressed for the funeral of many. Contains pants and suit.  
A face mask - It really is just a piece of cloth.  Increases armor slightly.  
```
There are no spiders here.   
> Put all on  
  
You cannot put them all on as it will replace some clothes  
> Put on the hoodie  
  
You put the hoodie over your shirt. Would you like to check your stats?  
> Yes

This is all you can find in this room but it is a nice room here. However you will not survive staying here  
> Check phones  
  
Out of batteries.  
Should you stay here a little longer?  
> Leave the house  
  
It's time to leave the house. You take a final look in this place of normalcy but you need to let it go. You leave the bedroom into the main room then out of the house  
A beautiful neighborhood is here with signs of no life around here which is better for you. You can see muscle rats eating a corpse with an open chest. You don't really know what it is but you can check it out  
> Check the corpse  
  
You take a closer look at the corpse but the rats are in the way. They look at you and screech. You shouldn't get any closer unless you want to fight them.  
> Leave  
  
You leave with your screwdriver in your pocket. This desolate place is something to behold. So many things to do but you need to do something.  
What is your plan?  
> Look for a market  
  
We gotta go deeper into the city no matter how trecherous it is. You drink a bottle of water. You continue onwards.  
You walk over the thick tree roots that are trying to block your way by breaking through the road and making a barrier. You don't really understand what these trees are but you feel like they are following you  
You continue down the road with many houses in ruins all brimming with loot but you need to survive first. Houses pass by as you make it to an intersection. You need to continue forward in order to reach a market of some sort. However, you hear some cries of help nearby. You look towards the cries but you cannot tell who is making them.  
> Follow the cries  
  
Whatever the cries are, you walk towards them. You are attracted to this cry as if you are moths to a light or perhaps more of a dangerous flame. You see a giant pulsating pink blob with faces and some hair in the middle of the road making strange gurgling noises and cries.  
> Run away  
  
It looks at you and gurgles. It is sliding towards you  
*The Amalgamation is attacking*  
Enemy HP: 20/20  
HP: 7/14  
> Attack the head  
  
You try stabbing the head of this creature but it just absorbs the blow  
The Amalgamation grabs you and scratches at you until you manage to get off it  
*The Amalgamation is attacking*  
Enemy HP: 20/20  
HP: 2/14  
> Run away  
  
You decide to panic and leave. Despite you running away, you felt like it is on your tail. You look back and see it throwing itself using its limb  to crawl towards you  
You are at the intersection  
> Fight  
  
*The Amalgamation is attacking*  
Enemy HP: 20/20  
HP: 2/14  
> Run away  
  
It caught up to you again as you chose to fight then panic last second. It lunges to grab you  
(reaction minigame)  
You dodge back in time before it grabs you. The faces on the blob is crying for you to kill it  
> Run into the city  
  
You can lose it there with all the buildings around. You run into the city where you were going to anyways to lose it. It screams at you to come back  
You can't take it anymore, you lost a point of sanity  
You look around  
> Go into a mega store  
  
The amalgamation is catching up. You run into the mega store to get away from it  
There is a car in the middle of the screen doors. It looks to have crashed there  
> Crawl in through the back seats outta the front  
  
You try opening the doors but it seems to be broken  
> Break window  
  
You hit the window to break it. It shatters  
> Crawl in  
  
You will surely bleed out if you crawl into the broken window  
> Proceed anyway  
  
You crawl through anyways. You felt something cut you. You are going into the front seat  
The amalgamation is trying to open the door. You are in the front seat   
> Turn car's key  
  
It doesn't work  
> Crawl out of the car and knock down shelves infront of the store door  
  
The front window is blocking you from going into the store. It's almost inside  
> Shatter one of the corners of the windoe with screwdriver  
  
You break the window and crawl out. The blob is inside the car  
> Run  
  
You are inside of the store. The shelves are toppled over  
> Find the guns  
  
You look around the store... It's too big to search with this on your tail. Unless you were sneaky...  
You can hear it break out of the car  
> Go hide  
  
You run into the back of the store. Your feet make loud noises as you run into the bathroom. You are inside of a bathroom here.  
> Barricade the door with anything we can find  
  
You tear off the worn stalls in front of the bathroom door making loud noises in the empty place  
> Look for a vent to crawl through  
  
As you were looking you saw something move behind you  
*The Shadow is fighting*  
> Spin the screwdriver into its head  
  
It dissipates into thin air. You are losing your mind. You lost sanity  
You look around and can't find a vent. There must be a way to get out of here.  
You stare at the ceiling tiles. It looks to be dripping with something  
> Stand on sink and try to push up a tile  
  
You open up a tile and see that there is empty space up here you can move around in  
> Crawl in  
  
You crawl up into the empty space. You thought you heard something telling you to go down  
> Continue  
  
You continue forward. You don't know where you are in relation of the store. It smells bad here. Looks like rotting meat here  
"Please... come back..." What?  
You felt yourself going back  
> Go down the deli  
  
You decide to go down to the deli ignoring the survivors  
You slip down behind the counter  
There is some old food here  
> Look around  
  
There must be something here that can help you...  
```
Batteries - Do they even work after all this time?  
A dull knife - It works more like a blunt weapon than a sharp weapon.  
```
You can hear it cry. It sounds close  
> GRAB AND RUN QUIETLY  
  
You run as quietly as you can but is slower than actually running  
You thought you saw it at the front of the store  
You look up and see aisle signs  
Where do you go?  
> Go to weaponery  
  
An amalgamation face looks at you from afar. It screeches  
You make your way to weaponry. Surely there is some guns here right?  
There are a lot of gun safe here but no guns. All the windows or doors appear to have been broken into  
The screech sounds louder  
> Run to the canned foods  
  
You decide to run to the canned food aisle. You need to grab something here at least  
You heard it cry again. You think about the beginning of the apocalpyse and...  
This looks like the movie aisle. How did you get here?  
The creature is knocking things down trying to get to you. You run to the food aisle to get something  
You look around quickly  
> Take any canned goods we see  
  
```
Canned food - Mmm... Meat in a can  
```
(sneaky reaction minigame)  
> Take  
  
You fumbled trying to grab it and it slips off your fingers as you run away. The creature absorbs it.   
You look around. Where do you go now?  
> Escape  
  
You run to the back of the store trying to look for something to let you out.  
Looks like an emergency exit  
**Opening this door will set off an alarm** it reads  
> Leave through the fire exit  
  
No matter, you need to leave now. You open it...  
You are in the back of the building with the gurgling of the creature muffled.  
It looks to be good here  
> Escape  
  
You run around to the side of the building to go to the roads but you are tired. You don't think you can run for a bit  
You eat some food  
It... it might be safe now You look around.   
> Punch the shadow  
  
You couldn't find anyone here. You punch your shadow but it wasn't trying to hurt you  
You felt crazy and paranoid doing that. You lost sanity  
Reality and delusions are starting to bleed together. What's the plan?

Your screwdriver is beginning to bend.  
> Try to remember what this apocalypse is and why it happened  
  
You remember going to work... taking your car... then... You shake your head  
You don't want to relive through losing it all  
> Remember the old peaceful room  
  
You felt as ease... You felt yourself gain your sanity back  
> Look at our hands  
  
You stare at the spikes sticking through your hands... then the ones at your arms. You remind yourself you need to shave them down again soon.  
> Check the rest of our body for any other spikes  
  
There are spikes sticking out all over, including the soles of your feet.  
What are you going to do?  
> Get out from hiding and get away from the store quietly  
  
You decide to leave the perimeter of the store completely. You are in the big city now alone with no life in you.  
> Try to find anything to heal us  
  
There is a plaza nearby you could check out  
There are several restaurants here, pet shops, clinics, and mail office  
> Check out clinic  
  
You decide to head out the clinic in this plaza. Going closer to it, you can see a humanoid near it. They seem to be staring at it but you can't quite tell at what it is  
> What does the humanoid look like  
  
They have spikes growing out of them  
> Sneak up  
  
You get up close to the person staring at the clinic but you need to be stealthy  
(reaction minigame)  
You successfully snuck up on them  
> Tackle  
  
Some sort of large coat and a bandana with a pack...  
You tackle him to the ground from behind forcing him down to land on his face. He falls down on his arms that stab right through his cheek. He grunts as he falls  
He stays down onto the ground  
"You got me, what do you want? I got no food on me."  
> Who are you?  
  
"Hunter... I'm just a person trying to get by like you..."  
> Where'd you get those spikes from  
  
"From the First Days"  
> “We really don’t wanna hurt you…”  
  
"I don't want to hurt you either. Now, are you going to rob me or not"  
"I got nothing on me You want me bag, take it"  
He is bleeding from a hole in his cheek as he gets up.  
He holsters his pistol. When did he get that out?  
> "I'm sorry..."   
  
"Yeah, sure. What do you want?"  
> "I just want to live"  
  
"As I do I"  
> “We can team up” show him spikes on our hands  
  
"Those spikes mean nothing. I have them too."  
> “I know, but people are rare…”  
  
"Dang thing I can't take out..." "I suppose nice people are rare"  
> “We only tackled you out of fright, we had no intentions of harming you”  
  
He grunts. "Well you got me. You want me to join up with you? I'll think about it"  
> Offer him a bottle of water  
  
"You don't have anything fresher?"  
> “No… it’s all I have…”  
  
"I'll take it then.."  
"Alright fine, you convinced me you are a good person. A little gift like that is something I haven't recieved in a long time"  
He looks at the clinic  
"I've been eying the place up for a bit trying to get the courage to go in. I heard things in there..."  
> “We could check that restaurant for knives maybe”  
  
"I guess we can do that. I'll follow the leader"  
> Quietly approach the Restaurant  
  
He follows along right behind not making a single noise  
  
> Whispering “Might be clean water too, but I doubt something as valuable as that would be left. If there is, I’ll let you get first sip”  
  
"Yup"  
> Approach a window and look inside  
  
There is something shining in the back of the kitchen  
> Check the window to see if it’s locked  
  
It is a window pane  
"Get through the front door dummy"  
You see him go into the building. He waves his hand over  
> Follow  
  
You are both here inside the restaurant. There is something glowing in the kitchen. You can't quite tell what it is  
> Get closer and see what it is  
  
You both walk over to the kitchen. You felt like you were yanked back by Hunter.  
"Don't go in there. That's the light"  
> "The light?"  
  
"You know, the light that you see at the end of the tunnel. Don't go near it"  
> “Gotcha… what does it do?”  
  
"Well you pass on"  
"Throw that plate to distract it"  
> Throw a plate as instructed  
  
The plate shatters and the light goes dim. It leaves the kitchen  
Hunter heads into the kitchen. "Come on"  
> "You saved me back there, thank you”  
  
"Yeah yeah"  
It looks like a mess in here. "Go grab what you want, I'll get a drink here"  
> Look for a knife in the mess  
  
You couldn't find a knife but you did find something else..  
```
Mallet - That’s it! I’m getting my mallet!  
```
> Bite down on something hard and attempt to mallet some of these spikes off  
  
"You got what you want? Oh shoot, not the best time but do what you want"  
Your spikes break in half and some of them went deep into your body as you tries breaking them.  
> Muffled “MOTHER OF FUUUUUUUUUU”  
  
"The light is coming back. We gotta go. Stop your whining and let's leave."  
> Follow Hunter  
  
You see Hunter leave out the kitchen window by vaulting through and out the restaurant  
The team is outside. "Got what you wanted?"  
> “yeah, We could probably get into that clinic now” Show meat beating mallet  
  
"Alright, let's do this" Hunter is peaking through the clinic window  
> "So what is this 'apocalypse'? i dont remember almost anything"  
  
"Shh, I don't want them to hear us. Check it out"  
There is a weird pulsating snake creature made of purely meat sliding across the floor of the clinic.  
"Follow me"  
> Follow  
  
He goes through the door into the clinic. "Get the drop on the Slither. Smack it with the hammer you got"  
> "Now? Okay" get the drop on it and mash it  
  
You jump towards it to smash down on it immediately splattering it across the floor and forcing it to puke out blood. It is dead on the spot.  
"Cool, let's find those stuff you want"  
You take a drink of water  
> "Anyways back to what i was saying before, do you know what caused this? Or what this is? I dont remember anything"  
  
"Some scientists thought he could cure all diseases in the world which made these flesh things. Then they came out from The Other Side because of some ritual things or whatever then- ah, some adrenaline"  
"Go get your stuff here"  
> Search
